                        Any individual contributor to a .NET Foundation project can apply to become a member.
                        Contributions may include code contributions, documentation, or other significant project
                        contribution, including evangelism, teaching, code, organizing events, etc. If in doubt,
                        please ask us at <a href="mailto:contact@dotnetfoundation.org">contact@dotnetfoundation.org</a>

                        Upon approval, members will be notified with information on completing their membership.
                        We’re requesting $100 annual dues, with liberal waivers for students or financial hardship.
                        Dues are voluntary - you can set your own amount, or opt-out entirely. We don't track
                        individual payment. We don't want dues to be a blocker for anyone who is interested in getting
                        involved.

                        Each year, we’ll host an election for the board of directors. Any active member can
                        campaign for a one year term, based on their community standing, plans to advance the .NET
                        open source ecosystem, and past performance in case they are seeking reelection.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each .NET Foundation member can vote in the election.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Just fill out the form below to let us know how you've contributed to one or more .NET Foundation
                    projects. Please be specific - don't just link to a project, link to individual commits, pull requests,
                    or other individual contributions.
