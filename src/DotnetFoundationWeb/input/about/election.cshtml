        <p>We recently announced some big changes to the .NET Foundation, and one of the biggest is that we’re moving to a community elected Board of Directors. <strong>We’re expanding the board from three to seven members, with one single seat appointed by Microsoft and the remaining six elected by the community.</strong> This structure will help the .NET Foundation scale and better serve the .NET ecosystem.</p>

        <p>The election results are in! <a href="@DotNetFoundation.AppSettings.BaseRef/results">Meet our next board of directors!</a></p>

        <p>The board completely runs the .NET Foundation. They decide how the money is spent, what projects join the foundation, what the Executive Director does, what programs the foundation will run or be involved with, what events we’ll sponsor. The board runs the foundation.</p>
