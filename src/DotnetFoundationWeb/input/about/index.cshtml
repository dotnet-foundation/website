                <p>
                    The .NET Foundation provides several services to support the projects in our community.
                    If you're currently running a project along these lines, or if you 're interested in kicking off a new idea,
                    please take a look at our New Project Checklist.
                </p>
                <h3>Management and administrative nitty-gritty</h3>
                <h4>Project guidance and mentoring</h4>
                <p>
                    New projects joining us will get mentorship on how to best run an open source community along with access
                    to developers currently seeking .NET projects. We work with project leads to help ensure the project grows
                    into a vibrant and welcoming community. And of course, we love to share best practices for managing a friendly,
                    collaborative, and innovative open source workplace, wherever you may be.
                </p>

                    IP and legal
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Legal can be tricky. We can help. Projects in our organization will get assistance to organize and manage their
                    IP assignments as well as infrastructure for tracking common, simple, Contribution License Agreements across all
                    .NET Foundation projects. We can also help ensure that your collaborators respect the open source licenses and trademarks
                    of projects assigned to the .NET Foundation. Need advice on legal issues? We offer support there as well.
                </p>

                    The more people who know about .NET, the better for the ecosystem. We work with Microsoft and other industry leaders
                    to improve your project 's exposure within the community at large. Your success is our success-we'd love to see you
                    achieve the accolades you deserve!

                                .NET Foundation code signing certificate. The certificate is well known to Windows Smart Screen, so people can install
                                your open-source application without warnings. It also allows for consuming applications knowing that the binary
                                downloaded is the one created on your build server.
