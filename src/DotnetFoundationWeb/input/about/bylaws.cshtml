                    .NET ecosystem and wider developer community by promoting openness, community
                    participation, and rapid innovation.

                    Incorporation, the Foundation is authorized to have members. Members will have the voting rights

                    Membership, (ii) be featured as Members on the Foundation website, and (iii) display the
                    Foundation’s logo or otherwise indicate Membership in the Foundation on such Member’s website
                    and in its marketing collateral, in accordance with the logo usage guidelines to be established by
                    the Foundation. Members will comply with the Membership Obligations in Section 3.3. Members
                    will have all of the rights and responsibilities conferred upon “members” under the Act.

                    terms of Membership as established by the Board of Directors, including the terms and conditions
                    of the Foundation’s Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, and such terms, rules and policies as the
                    Board of Directors may adopt (“Membership Obligations”). The Membership Obligations may
                    be memorialized in a separate Membership Agreement adopted by the Board of Directors, and will
                    include both (a) a requirement that Members will publicly support the Foundation, its corporate
                    purpose stated above, and a thriving ecosystem of open source software projects (including those
                    housed within the Foundation) taking advantage of the .NET programming model, and (b) ensuring
                    the Foundation has Member’s accurate and current contact information including email address
                    and providing a record of its consent to the provision of all notices from the Foundation using such
                    email address it provides or updates from time to time. A Member shall remain in good standing
                    as a Member provided such Member is in compliance with Membership Obligations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>3.4 Transfer of Memberships.</strong> Memberships shall be non-transferable, non-salable
                    and non-assignable, except that any Member may transfer its Membership for the then-current year
                    to a successor to substantially all of its business and/or assets, whether by merger, sale or
                    otherwise; provided that the transferee agrees to be bound by the Membership Obligations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>3.5 Additional Classes of Members.</strong> The conditions, privileges, powers, and voting
                    rights (if any) of any class of Members may be changed, and one or more additional classes of
                    Membership may be created, and the conditions, voting rights, powers and privileges of each such
                    class may be prescribed, by adoption of an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation and these
                    Bylaws pursuant to Section 10.4 hereof.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>3.6 Resignation by Member.</strong> A Member may resign as a Member at any time. Any
                    Financial Obligations already paid by such Member shall not be refundable in such event, and all
                    such Financial Obligations of such Member which may be accrued and unpaid as of such date shall
                    remain due and payable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>3.7 Levy of Dues, Assessments or Fees.</strong> The Foundation may levy dues, assessments
                    or fees upon its Members in such amounts as may be approved from time to time by the Board of
                    Directors (“Financial Obligations”), as provided in Section 3.3 above, but a Member upon
                    learning of any new fees or increase in fees may avoid liability therefor by resigning from
                    Membership prior to the date such fees are due and payable. In no event shall the failure of a
                    Member to pay any fees give rise to any claim in favor of the Foundation for indirect or
                    consequential damages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>3.8 Use of Names.</strong> Neither the Foundation nor any Member shall use the name of the
                    other in any form of publicity without the permission of the other, provided that the Foundation
                    and any Member may each disclose and publicize such Member’s Membership in the Foundation.

                    <strong>5.1 General Powers.</strong> The business and affairs of the Foundation shall be conducted
                    under the direction of, and the control and disposal of the Foundation’s assets shall be vested in,

                    of open source software projects to the Foundation) and a form of the Contribution Agreement (for
                    contributions to open source software projects within the Foundation). Once adopted, these
                    agreements may only be changed or replaced by affirmative vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the directors

                    project as a “benevolent director,” (ii) the rights of the Foundation as to the project and its name,
                    and (iii) the rights of the broader community to use the project, including what open source licenses
                    may be used for projects and the policies for accurate and referential use of project names. Once
                    adopted, the governance process may only be changed or replaced by the affirmative vote of twothirds (2/3) of the directors then in office.

                    faith, in a manner that such director believes to be in the best interests of the Foundation, and with
                    such care, including reasonable inquiry, as an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would
                    use under similar circumstances.

                <p>
                    <strong>5.4 Number and Selection of Directors.</strong> The number of directors will be 3. The

                    (a) The initial directors are those individuals named in the Articles of Incorporation,
                    where Jay Schmelzer and Gianugo Rabellino shall represent the Member elected and appointed
                    directors provided for under Section 5.4(b)(i) and Miguel de Icaza shall represent the community
                    elected director provided for under Section 5.4(b)(ii).
                    (b) All subsequent directors shall be appointed as follows:
                    (i) two directors shall be appointed and elected by the Members as determined
                    by a majority vote of the Members; and
                    (ii) one director shall be elected by a majority vote of the community, such
                    community comprised of any person who is an active member of the .NET community, which may
                    include adopting, contributing to, or supporting open source software projects within the
                    Foundation.
                    Elections of directors will occur under a process approved by the then-current Board of Directors,
                    and will be effective immediately upon completion of the election. Appointments of directors by
                    Members will be made by written notice to the Foundation, and will be effective as of the specified
                    future date in the appointment notice or, if no date is specified, the date of receipt by the
                    Foundation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>5.5 Term.</strong> The initial directors shall serve until the Members appoint or elect directors
                    pursuant to Section 5.4(b) above. All directors shall serve terms of one year, or until their earlier
                    death, resignation or removal, except that directors will continue to serve in that capacity until the
                    appointing Member replaces them or until an election for their seat is completed (as applicable).
                    Any director, including the initial directors, may serve an unlimited number of terms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>5.6 Vacancies.</strong> Vacancies on the Board of Directors shall be filled in accordance with
                    Section 5.4(b) hereof.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>5.7 Resignation.</strong> Any director may resign at any time by written notice to the
                    Foundation; provided, that if the resignation would result in the Foundation having no director, the
                    resigning director shall continue to serve as a director until a successor director is appointed and
                    qualified as provided in these Bylaws or by action of the Members.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>5.8 Removal.</strong> Any appointed director may be removed, with or without cause, at any
                    time by the Member that appointed such director, by written notice to the Foundation. Elected
                    directors may only be removed by election of a replacement director.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>5.9 Compensation.</strong> Directors shall not receive compensation for their services as such,
                    although the reasonable expenses of directors for attendance at Board of Directors meetings or
                    otherwise directly incident to their duties as directors may be paid by the Foundation.

                <p>
                    <strong>9.3.1</strong> Notification and Defense of Claim. Indemnitee shall promptly notify the
                    Foundation, in the form of a record, of any Proceeding for which indemnification could be sought
                    under this Article or the Articles of Incorporation. In addition, Indemnitee shall give the
                    Foundation such information and cooperation as it may reasonably require and as shall be within
                    Indemnitee’s power. With respect to any such Proceeding as to which Indemnitee has notified the

                    the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to Indemnitee. Indemnitee’s consent to such counsel
                    may not be unreasonably withheld. After notice from the Foundation to Indemnitee of its election
                    to assume the defense, the Foundation will not be liable to Indemnitee under this Article for any
                    Expenses subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such defense. Indemnitee shall,
                    however, continue to have the right to employ its counsel in such Proceeding, at Indemnitee’s
                    expense.
                    The Foundation shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Proceeding brought by, or on
                    behalf of, the Foundation or as to which Indemnitee shall reasonably have made the conclusion
                    that a conflict of interest may exist between the Foundation and the Indemnitee in the conduct of
                    the defense. In such case, the Foundation will be responsible for reimbursing Indemnitee for the

                    <strong>9.3.2</strong> Information to be Submitted and Method of Determination and
                    Authorization of Indemnification. For the purpose of pursuing rights to indemnification under
                    the Articles of Incorporation and/or this Article, Indemnitee shall submit to the Board of Directors
                    a sworn statement requesting indemnification and reasonable evidence of all amounts for which
                    such indemnification is requested (together, the sworn statement and the evidence constitute an
                    “Indemnification Statement”). Submission of an Indemnification Statement to the Board of
                    Directors shall create a presumption that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification hereunder,
                    and the Foundation shall, within sixty (60) calendar days thereafter, make the payments requested
                    in the Indemnification Statement to, or for the benefit of, the Indemnitee, unless: (a) within such
                    sixty (60) calendar day period it shall be determined by the Foundation that the Indemnitee is not
                    entitled to indemnification under the Articles of Incorporation; (b) such vote shall be based upon
                    clear and convincing evidence (sufficient to rebut the foregoing presumption); and (c) the
                    Indemnitee shall receive notice of such determination in the form of a record, which shall disclose
                    with particularity the evidence upon which the determination is based. The foregoing
                    determination shall be made (a) by the Board of Directors by majority vote of a quorum consisting
                    of Directors not at the time parties to the Proceeding; (b) if a quorum cannot be obtained under
                    (a) in this paragraph, by majority vote of a committee duly designated by the Board of Directors,
                    in which designation Directors who are Parties may participate, consisting solely of two or more
                    Directors not at the time Parties to the Proceeding; or (c) by special legal counsel as provided by
                    RCW 23B.08.550. Any determination that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, and
                    any failure to make the payments requested in the Indemnification Statement, shall be subject to
                    judicial review by any court of competent jurisdiction.

                <p>
                    <strong>9.3.3</strong> Special Procedure Regarding Advance for Expenses. An Indemnitee
                    seeking payment of Expenses in advance of a final disposition of the Proceeding must furnish the
                    Foundation, as part of the Indemnification Statement:
                    (a) a written affirmation, given in the form of a record, of the Indemnitee’s
                    good faith belief that the Indemnitee has met the standard of conduct required to be eligible for
                    indemnification; and
                    (b) a written undertaking, in the form of a record constituting an unlimited
                    general obligation of the Indemnitee, to repay the advance if it is ultimately determined by the
                    final disposition of a court of competent jurisdiction that the Indemnitee did not meet the required
                    standard of conduct. If the Foundation determines that indemnification is authorized, the
                    Indemnitee’s request for advance of Expenses shall be granted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>9.3.4</strong> Settlement. The Foundation is not liable to indemnify Indemnitee for any
                    amounts paid in settlement of any Proceeding without the Foundation’s consent, given in the form
                    of a record. The Foundation shall not settle any Proceeding in any manner that would impose any
                    penalty or limitation on Indemnitee without Indemnitee’s consent, given in the form of a record.
                    Neither the Foundation nor Indemnitee may unreasonably withhold its consent to a proposed
                    settlement.

                <p>
                    <strong>9.4.1</strong> Contract Rights. The right of an Indemnitee to indemnification and
                    advancement of Expenses is a contract right upon which the Indemnitee shall be presumed to have
                    relied in determining to serve, or to continue to serve, in his or her capacity with the Foundation.
                    Such right shall continue as long as the Indemnitee shall be subject to any possible Proceeding.
                    Any amendment to, or repeal of, this Article shall not adversely affect any right or protection of
                    an Indemnitee with respect to any acts or omissions of such Indemnitee occurring prior to such
                    amendment or repeal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>9.4.2</strong> Optional Insurance, Contracts, and Funding. The Foundation may:
                    (a) Maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any Indemnitee
                    against any Liability;
                    (b) Enter into contracts with any Indemnitee in furtherance of this Article and
                    consistent with the Act; and
                    (c) Create a trust fund, grant a security interest, or use other means (including,
                    without limitation, a letter of credit) to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary
                    to effect indemnification as provided in this Article.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>9.4.3</strong> Severability. If any provision or application of this Article shall be invalid
                    or unenforceable, the remainder of this Article and its remaining applications shall not be affected
                    thereby, and shall continue in full force and effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>9.4.4</strong> Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit. If (a) a claim under the Articles of
                    Incorporation and/or this Article for indemnification is not paid in full by the Foundation within
                    sixty (60) days after notice of a claim has been received by the Foundation; or (b) a claim under
                    this Article for advancement of Expenses is not paid in full by the Foundation within twenty
                    (20) days after notice of a claim, then the Indemnitee may, but need not, at any time thereafter
                    bring suit against the Foundation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. To the extent
                    successful in whole or in part, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to also be paid the expense (to be
                    proportionately prorated if the Indemnitee is only partially successful) of prosecuting such claim.
                    Neither (a) the failure of the Foundation (including its Board of Directors or independent legal
                    counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such Proceeding that
                    indemnification or reimbursement or advancement of Expenses to the Indemnitee is proper in the
                    circumstances, nor (b) an actual determination by the Foundation (including its Board of Directors
                    or its independent legal counsel) that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or to the
                    reimbursement or advancement of Expenses, shall be a defense to the Proceeding or create a
                    presumption that the Indemnitee is not so entitled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>9.5 Exceptions.</strong> Notwithstanding any other provision herein or in the Foundation’s
                    Articles of Incorporation to the contrary, the Foundation shall not be obligated pursuant to the
                    terms of this Article to indemnify or advance Expenses to Indemnitee with respect to any
                    Proceeding:
                    (a) Initiated or brought voluntarily by Indemnitee and not by way of defense, except
                    with respect to Proceedings brought to establish or enforce a right to indemnification under the
                    Bylaws, or any other statute or law or as otherwise required under the statute; but such
                    indemnification or advancement of Expenses may be provided by the Foundation in specific cases
                    if the Board of Directors finds it to be appropriate.
                    (b) Instituted by Indemnitee to enforce or interpret rights under the Bylaws, if a court
                    of competent jurisdiction determines that each of the material assertions made by Indemnitee in
                    such Proceeding was not made in good faith or was frivolous.
                    (c) For which any of the Expenses or Liabilities for indemnification being sought have
                    been paid directly to Indemnitee by an insurance carrier under an insurance policy maintained by
                    the Foundation.
                    (d) If the Foundation is prohibited by its Articles of Incorporation, the Act or other
                    applicable law as then in effect from paying such indemnification and/or advancement of
                    Expenses.
