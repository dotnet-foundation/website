## Why I'm Running

My name is Spencer Schneidenbach and my interest in the .NET Foundation Board of Directors is centered around **advocacy and outreach**. As a community leader, my goal is to represent the interests of community leaders around the globe, including but not limited to: user group leaders, conference organizers, other Microsoft MVPs, bloggers, and conferences speakers.

**I have proven experience in building relationships with the .NET community**, as well as communities outside of our own. I want to **leverage those relationships to advance the cause of the .NET ecosystem**. Further, I want to expand that by representing .NET in communities where it may not normally be first-choice and/or still has a bad rap from the "old" Microsoft days ðŸ™‚ **By nurturing adoption of .NET, we can ensure a healthy, vibrant, and resilient community.**

I also have an interest in representing corporate and/or so-called "[dark matter](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/DarkMatterDevelopersTheUnseen99.aspx) " developers. Because I frequently attend and speak at conferences around the world, I get the pleasure of interacting with folks who normally do not get a voice at the table. I've traded tweets and emails with many of these folks, with the goal of making .NET more accessible for developers worldwide.

By earning a seat on the .NET Foundation board of directors, **I want to be a clear and focused voice to and for the .NET community**, while continuing to teach the larger developer community all of the benefits of using .NET.

I'm also a big believer in brevity, which is why I tried to keep my campaign statement short. ðŸ˜ƒ

## A little more about me
