## About Me and My .NET Contributions

* **I'm the project lead of BenchmarkDotNet**  
  [BenchmarkDotNet](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet) is a powerful .NET library for benchmarking with tons of features which help to design benchmarks, execute them, and analyze performance results. BenchmarkDotNet is a highly adopted open-source project which is used for performance investigations in various .NET projects including .NET Core Runtime. On GitHub, you can find hundreds of [issues](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=BenchmarkDotNet+-repo:dotnet%2FBenchmarkDotNet&s=created&type=Issues&utf8=✓) and [commits](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=BenchmarkDotNet+-repo:dotnet%2FBenchmarkDotNet&s=committer-date&type=Commits&utf8=✓) which involve BenchmarkDotNet. The [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BenchmarkDotNet/) has 1.2M+ downloads.
* **I'm a contributor to various .NET projects**  
  I have contributions to different .NET projects like [dotnet/coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/commits?author=AndreyAkinshin), [dotnet/corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/commits?author=AndreyAkinshin), [dotnet/wpf](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/commits?author=AndreyAkinshin), [dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/commits?author=AndreyAkinshin), [mono/mono](https://github.com/mono/mono/commits?author=AndreyAkinshin), [NuGet/NuGet.Client](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/commits?author=AndreyAkinshin), and others.
* **I'm the program director of DotNext**  
  [DotNext](https://dotnext.ru/en/) is the largest conference about .NET in Russia with around 1000 attendees. Each our conference offers about 30 talks from acclaimed experts: Jon Skeet, Jeffrey Richter, Sasha Goldshtein, Dino Esposito, and Andrei Alexandrescu already given their talks on DotNext. We focus on in-depth technical content about high-performance and fault-tolerant systems, .NET Core and cross-platform development, .NET internals, Roslyn, development tools, and so on.
* **I'm a frequent speaker at various events for developers**  
  I have done about 100 [public talks](https://aakinshin.net/about/#talks) on different topics. My favorite topics are micro-optimizations, benchmarking, and tools for .NET developers.
* **I'm a Microsoft .NET MVP since 2015**  
  Also, I have a lot of [blog posts](https://aakinshin.net/about/#posts) and [articles](https://aakinshin.net/about/#publications).
* **I'm a developer of Rider at JetBrains**  
  [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) is a cross-platform .NET IDE based on the [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) platform and [ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/). I'm trying to provide the best development experience for .NET, ASP.NET, .NET Core, Xamarin, or Unity applications on Windows, Mac, and Linux. My primary areas of responsibility are NuGet package management, unit testing support, cross-platform development, and IDE performance.
* **I'm a huge fan of science**  
  I'm a Ph.D. in Mathematics and Computer Science, the subject of my thesis is "Mathematical and numerical modeling of gene networks artificial regulatory circuits." In my free time, I like to study science, my primary research interests are mathematical biology and bifurcation theory. Previously, I worked as a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Weizmann Institute of Science](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/) and as a research scientist in the [Sobolev Institute of Mathematics SB RAS](http://math.nsc.ru/english.html).

## Why I'm Running

My dream is to make .NET the best platform for development. And I believe that it should evolve in the following directions:

* **Runtime**  
  We need a stable high-performance runtime which can execute our applications.
* **Ecosystem and libraries**  
  We need a healthy ecosystem with reliable solutions for all kinds of problems. We should support more awesome projects which are important for the .NET ecosystem.
* **Tooling**  
  We need fast and powerful tools which simplify software development. We should focus on the logic of our programs instead of performing boring and routine tasks.
* **Community**  
  We should have various events for .NET developers: from small local meetups to large professional conferences. We need places where we can share ideas and exchange experiences.

I'm sure that I have enough expertise to help .NET Foundation to make the life of .NET developers better. =)
