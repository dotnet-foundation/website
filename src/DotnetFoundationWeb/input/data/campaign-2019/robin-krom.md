# .NET Foundation Campaign: Robin Krom

![me](campaign-2019/2a562e01-9cda-4202-a901-4c1850cb33c9.jpg)

## Why I'm Running

Hello, my name is **Robin Krom**, I am 43 years old, Dutch, father, husband, dog owner, living & working in Germany, a professional Java and passionate .NET developer. I've been working as an IT professional since 1998. One of my main interests is technologies - understanding, trying out and explaining them to others is what I consider part of my job and also do for a hobby.

As a developer I work with 2 major ecosystems, Java from my point of view the more mature and .NET the bright burning star in the sky. It's interesting to see how those different ecosystems have, on a high level, many similarities but different backgrounds and implementations. There is much to be learned from looking at both, which is something I can bring to the table when needed.

A big passion of mine is the open source world, and I can only admire the work of the .NET Foundation as [the services](/about) that are provided is very large. The project guidance and mentoring is what appeals the most to me. As a developer I learned the hard way that maintaining an open source project has many challenges that are not related to programming, something which is currently reflected by many other open source maintainers. Finding time to work on the project, staying motivated and professional when people are complaining or even ranting about decisions or issue response times, seem to be the topic of the day. There is even something called open source burnout, which should not be taken lightly. I wish to help by providing support, a discussion platform, success stories, or make bad examples and real cases known so they can be used to learn from.

Having worked for multinationals and being onsite at many different sized companies, I have seen how open source is used throughout the world. To be honest, the current state is very unhealthy, there is a lot which needs to be done. The .NET Foundation has a unique position which can be used to inform the consumers of open source with professional tips on what they can do to keep a project healthy. This should be in their interest while these projects are used in critical parts of their daily business. This information could be supplied / linked via the release notes or other locations with every project.

I think my background gives me a certain advantage when confronted with new technologies, taught me to be open for new ideas, and will help me to support the .NET Foundation in the best way.


## My .NET Contributions
In my spare time I am the main developer of Greenshot for Windows, which is an OSS & free screenshot tool written with .NET technologies. Although (even to me) a screenshot tool sounds like something fairly simple, it's amazing how much time, effort and knowledge one can (and should) put into this. Due to having a quite substantial amount of users, a lot of my time is spent on answering questions and keeping our project alive. Current development is focused on modernizing and making the whole project more community friendly.

Last year I got into contact with Microsoft about how we can use Greenshot as one of the early adopters of the desktop technologies coming to dotnet core 3.0, while to me it felt like a perfect fit. Following this discussion there were a couple of meetings, where I was able to give input on how I was using the .NET Framework up to now. As soon as the first night-lies of dotnet core 3.0 were available I started the journey which was the actual work on porting, exchanging information with other projects and reporting issues when needed. More can be read in a blog-post & tweet which were mentioned in the [dotnet blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-preview-1-and-open-sourcing-windows-desktop-frameworks/)

In the company I work for there is only a small fraction of people using .NET as a technology, I try to be a .NET advocate by supporting them where possible, giving advice, code reviews, and writing news-letters about things happening in the world which might influences their daily work.
