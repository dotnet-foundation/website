# .NET Foundation Campaign: Jamie Rees

## Why I'm Running
Hi I'm Jamie,

So the reason I want to run for this is because of one thing. I am passionate about everything .Net. If I am able to help in anyway shape or form then I will try my best. So, when I see that you guys are open to board members, this in my opinion was a perfect way to contribute and help the .Net ecosystem that I so much wanted to do.

My dream during my development career is to make a difference, and I feel like if I was elected, I would be able to fulfil that dream. But it's not just about me, it's about everyone else that is affected by any decisions made and that's the important part.

Outside of all things .Net my time is pretty limited, I have a 2-year-old boy, a 13-week-old Puppy and I run a popular open source library, that includes bug fixing, new features and general support! And sometimes my wife likes to spend some time with me :) 

If you have any questions or want to know anything else about me let me know!

## My .NET Contributions
My main .Net contribution is probably my StackOverflow account. I regular help the community and try and answer questions with as much information as possible (I only have 4K rep, but that's an achievement for me).

My other contributions are not strictly .net coding, but I've been bringing awareness to .Net through my open source project [Ombi](https://github.com/tidusjar/ombi). All the backend is written in .Net Core and I make sure my users know about this, debunking the old myths they may have about the Microsoft ecosystem.

Unfortunately, I've not had the chance of speaking at any conferences, so I would not be able to comment on that. I think it's something I would like to do in the future, but I currently lack the confidence to do that!

## What can I bring?
A fresh look and perspective, I am not your typical boring developer, I have a strong passion and enthusiasm.
From my experience of open source (mainly from Ombi) I understand the pressure and transparency that is required, so I'd try and ensure that everything is transparent as possible. The more information the consumer has the better!

As an open source project owner, I understand all the issues that Open Source Projects will face as I have faced them before and currently have issues. I have had legal, support, cost issues and burnout. I think I would be an excellent person to assist on the support and help achieve a better understanding of the needs that open source projects have.

Other than that, I am working with .Net and a lot of the foundation projects every single day, I am an avid consumer so it's also in my best interests to achieve the best possible outcomes for this community.
