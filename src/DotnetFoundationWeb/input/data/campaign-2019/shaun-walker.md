# .NET Foundation Campaign: Shaun Walker

![Shaun Walker](campaign-2019/shaun-walker.png)

## Why I'm Running
I am currently the Chairman of the Advisory Council for the .NET Foundation where I helped author the original Advisory Council charter. As part of this role, I have interacted on a weekly basis since 2014 with the .NET Foundation Executive Director ( previously Martin Woodward and now Jon Galloway ). I am also the original creator of DotNetNuke, a Web Application Framework for ASP.NET which was one of the pioneering open source community projects native to the Microsoft platform. I have 25+ years professional experience in architecting and implementing enterprise software solutions for private and public organizations. Based on my significant community contributions I have been recognized as a Microsoft MVP and ASPInsider for over 10 consecutive years. I was recognized by Business In Vancouver in 2011 as a leading entrepreneur in their Forty Under 40 business awards, and I was also an interim Board member for the OuterCurve (CodePlex) Foundation, Microsoft's previous open source foundation effort. I am currently employed as a Technical Director and Enterprise Guildmaster at Cognizant Softvision.

## My .NET Contributions
I am the author of, or contributor to, many open source projects. Some of the better known:

DNN: https://github.com/dnnsoftware/Dnn.Platform
Hotcakes: https://github.com/HotcakesCommerce
eShopOnContainers: https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers

I also speak at various conferences on topics such as .NET Core.
