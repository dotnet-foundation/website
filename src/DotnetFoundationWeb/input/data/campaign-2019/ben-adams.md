# .NET Foundation Campaign: Ben Adams

## Why I'm Running

.NET is my passion and I'd like the .NET ecosystem to thrive with projects people consider and take dependencies on to be much wider than the narrow "Microsoft-blessed" scope that people and companies generally consider.

## My .NET Contributions
My .NET contributions have been most around making .NET faster and with less allocations.
