<h2><a href="https://www.dotnetconf.net/">.NET Conf 2019</a></h2>

<p>It's a wrap on .NET Conf 2019 (September 23 - 25) and it was the largest one yet! I don't have the exact numbers available, but Javier Lozano, one of the founders of the conference assures me it was significantly larger in attendance than last year. [Note: More info on .NET Conf, including some actual stats, below.]</p>

<p>For those who don't know, .NET Conf is a virtual conference with speakers from all over the planet. If you missed it,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLReL099Y5nRd04p81Q7p5TtyjCrj9tz1t"><strong>all the sessions are available on YouTube!</strong></a></p>

<p>During the conference, the .NET Foundation announced a proposal to develop a Project Maturity Model, which leads to the next update.</p>

<hr />
<p></p>

<h2>Rethinking the Project Maturity ModelðŸ¤”</h2>

<p>The .NET Foundation Board engaged with the community and received a ton of feedback both positive, neutral, and negative regarding the proposal mentioned above. The feedback helped us realize that we made a mistake in our approach and need to scrap the proposal and rethink the approach.&nbsp;<a href="/blog/2019/09/30/rethinking-project-maturity-as-a-community-process">Find out more in this blog post</a>&nbsp;by Ben Adams, a .NET Foundation board member.</p>

<p>And a big thank you to everyone who commented on the proposal! Your feedback is valuable.</p>

<hr />
<p></p>

<h2>Welcoming AWS as a Corporate Sponsor</h2>

<p>Also at .NET Conf, we annouced that&nbsp;<a href="/blog/2019/09/23/welcoming-aws">AWS is joining our Corporate Sponsor program</a>! The AWS team talked about why they're joining&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/aws-joins-the-net-foundation/">here</a>.</p>

<hr />
<p></p>

<h2>.NET Core 3.0 Released</h2>

<p>One of the highlights of .NET Conf was the release of .NET Core 3.0. Find out&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-core-3-0">what's new in 3.0 here</a>. This is a major release bump so there will be breaking changes. Even so, I for one am looking forward to upgrading my code to reap&nbsp;<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-net-core-3-0/">all the performance benefits</a>.</p>

<p>It's an exciting time to be a .NET developer!</p>

<h2>.NET Conf - Stats and Highlights</h2>

<p>As Phil said above, this year's .NET Conf was the biggest yet! How big?</p>

<ul>
<li>Over 100K total live stream views (up 27% from last year!)</li>
<li>67K unique viewers</li>
<li>77 live sessions, including 32 in studio and the rest during a 24 hour community presented all-nighter</li>
</ul>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLReL099Y5nRd04p81Q7p5TtyjCrj9tz1t">session videos</a>&nbsp;were all recorded and are going up on YouTube. We're still getting the community sessions posted - sorry for the delay, we've got to chop up a single 24 hour, 50GB video into dozens of individual files and get them all uploaded to YouTube. Soon!<br />
<br />
Check out the .NET Conf 2019 Keynote, with tons of demos featuring the brand new .NET Core 3.0:</p>

<h2>.NET Foundation Project Updates</h2>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly">Polly</a></h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#711">Polly version 7.1.1</a>&nbsp;released: bug fix for async retries with&nbsp;<code>.ConfigureAwait(true)</code></p>

<p>The Polly-Contrib community continues to grow, with two new releases:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Polly.Contrib.WaitAndRetry</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/Polly-Contrib/Polly.Contrib.WaitAndRetry">github</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Polly.Contrib.WaitAndRetry">nuget</a>): provides a new jitter strategy for decorrelating retries in highly concurrent scenarios, as well as a range of helper methods for common wait-and-retry scenarios such as exponential backoff. The new jitter strategy offers a smoother distribution (stronger decorrelation) than previous jitter recommendations, combined with a well-defined exponential backoff characteristic. Thanks to&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/george-polevoy">@george-polevoy</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/grant-d">@grant-d</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyrmn">@hyrmn</a>&nbsp;for making this project a reality!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Polly-Contrib/Polly.Contrib.AzureFunctions.CircuitBreaker">Polly.Contrib.AzureFunctions.CircuitBreaker</a></strong>: is a durable, distributed circuit-breaker, implemented in the new&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-entities">Azure Entity Functions (preview)</a>. The distributed circuit-breaker can be consumed from within plain Azure functions and Azure orchestration functions, and is fully stateful and consistent across function invocations and function app scale-out. The circuit-breaker also exposes an external Http api, making it consumable as a general distributed circuit-breaker for apps or components outside functions. Authored by the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/reisenberger">core Polly team</a></p>

<h3><a href="https://aka.ms/wct">Windows Community Toolkit</a></h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/releases/tag/10.0.1">Version 10</a>&nbsp;of ReactiveUI that added .NET Core 3.0 WPF/Winforms and Blazor preview support. The release also offered a bunch of performance upgrades converting from Tuple to ValueTuple, and using non-reflection based Observables.</p>

<p>We are working on changing the way the Initialization is done within ReactiveUI v11 to make it more obvious to users how it is performed and remove reflection.</p>

<hr />
<h3>IdentityServer 3.0 released - and now part of the ASP.NET Core 3 templates</h3>

<p>IdentityServer4 3.0 is now compatible with ASP.NET Core 3. The focus of this release was mostly to make sure everything is working with the new ASP.NET Core version, but also adds a couple of new features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adding the last missing pieces for&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">FAPI</a>&nbsp;compliance

</ul>

<p>IdentityServer4 is also now included in the new Angular and React templates in Visual Studio. See&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity-api-authorization">here</a>&nbsp;for documentation.</p>
