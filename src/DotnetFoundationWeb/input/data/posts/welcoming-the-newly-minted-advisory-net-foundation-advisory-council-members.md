<p>It&rsquo;s official &ndash; we&rsquo;re happy to welcome nine community leaders to the .NET Foundation Advisory Council &ndash; leaders who will bring their experience and passion to help steward open source .NET projects and continue on a path of open and transparent governance for the foundation.</p>

<p>The .NET Foundation Board has been selecting these individuals from an impressive roster, and we had to make some difficult choices to come up with the initial list. A few months down the road, we expect the Advisory Council to come up with a more participatory process to ensure that the next Advisory Council is selected by the .NET community at large.</p>

<p>Please join me in welcoming the newly minted Advisory Council members:</p>

<ul>
<li>Shaun Walker &ndash; Software Architect. Ex-Project leader for DotNetNuke open source product and ecosystem.</li>
<li>Immo Landwerth &ndash; Senior Engineer from Microsoft .NET Framework team helping lead open source initiatives.</li>
<li>JB Evain &ndash; Founder and Project Leader at SyntaxTree open source projects. Senior Software engineer at Microsoft.</li>
<li>Daniel Roth &ndash; Senior Engineer from Microsoft ASP.NET Framework team helping lead open source initiatives.</li>
<li>Bill Wagner &ndash; Humanitarian Toolbox contributor, author and speaker for .NET technologies. C# MVP, and Regional Director for .NET Framework.</li>
<li>Phil Haack&ndash; Engineering Manager at GitHub with significant open source contributions and experience.</li>
<li>Mirco 'meebey' Bauer &ndash; Co-founder of Debian Mono Group, GNOME foundation member. CTO at GSD Software Design GmbH.</li>
<li>Marcus Wendt - Project Leader on Composite C1 OSS project and active speaker on .NET technologies.</li>
<li>Dominick Baier &ndash; Project Leader on ThinkTecture projects in .NET Foundation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many of you may know these individuals already, by collaborating through code or conferences, on a number of .NET-related projects. Each of them brings a record of independence, impartiality and candor, which will help guide key decisions affecting the direction of the foundation. We&rsquo;re proud to have them represent the community and the foundation through their continued open source evangelism.</p>

<p>Our heartfelt thanks go to all those who stepped up and volunteered to help, especially to those who have not been selected just yet: just like everyone in the .NET community, we are looking forward to your continued participation and assistance as we continue our journey.</p>

<p>Advisory Council members look forward to any suggestion, criticism and assistance, as does the foundation board. Please continue to <a href="http://forums.dotnetfoundation.org/">send us feedback </a>as we work together for a stronger .NET open source community.</p>
