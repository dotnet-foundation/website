<p>Json.NET is a popular high-performance JSON framework for .NET. It's very well known to .NET developers - with over <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/">164 million NuGet downloads</a>, it's by far the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/stats">most popular community NuGet package</a> and a fundamental part of the .NET open source ecosystem.</p>

<p>Supporting .NET open source projects like Json.NET is a core part of the .NET Foundation's mission. As part of bringing the Json.NET project onboard, we've been able to help support James and team with the Json.NET 12&nbsp;release. A key example is getting the project set up with the<a href="blog/2018/07/03/new-community-director-claire-novotny"> .NET Foundation's code signing service</a> and providing a code signing certificate.</p>
