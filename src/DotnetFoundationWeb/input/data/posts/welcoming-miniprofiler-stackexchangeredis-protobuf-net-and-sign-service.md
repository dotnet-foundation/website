<p>Today, I'm happy to announce that MiniProfiler for .NET, StackExchange.Redis, protobuf-net, and Sign Service are joining the .NET&nbsp;Foundation!</p>

<h2>MiniProfiler for .NET</h2>

<p><a href="https://miniprofiler.com/dotnet/">MiniProfiler for .NET</a> is a&nbsp;simple but effective mini-profiler for ASP.NET (and Core) websites.</p>

<h2>StackExchange.Redis</h2>

<p><a href="https://stackexchange.github.io/StackExchange.Redis/">StackExchange.Redis</a> is a high performance general purpose redis client for .NET languages (C# etc).&nbsp;</p>

<h2>protobuf-net</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mgravell/protobuf-net">protobuf-net</a> is a contract based serializer for .NET code, that happens to write data in the "protocol buffers" serialization format.</p>

<h2>Sign Service</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/SignService">Sign Service</a> aims to make it easier to integrate Authenticode signing into a CI process by providing a secured API for submitting artifacts to be signed by a code signing cert held on the server. It uses Azure AD and Azure Key Vault's HSM for security. We've been using Sign Service for years behind the scenes to code sign many of our .NET Foundation projects, this is just making it official.</p>

<p>Welcome!</p>
