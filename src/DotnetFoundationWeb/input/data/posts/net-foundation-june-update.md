<p>Hey!&nbsp; Here's the June edition of the .NET Foundation newsletter. Every month, we'll give you a quick overview of the .NET Open Source landscape, including top project news, events, community links and more.</p>

<p>Did I say every month? Well, we took May off... it was a really busy month, with some .NET releases and announcements, followed by a lot of conferences. It was great to talk to a lot of you in person, either at our .NET Open Source booth at Build or the conferences I attended after that - Red Hat Summit, Techorama,&nbsp;and DevSum.<br />
<br />
This month's newsletter includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>A summary of the recent .NET releases and upcoming roadmap announcements&nbsp;</li>
<li>.NET Meetup news</li>
<li>Info on .NET Conf, coming this September</li>
<li>News from .NET Foundation member projects</li>
<li>Some .NET OSS community news links from the past month</li>
</ul>

<p>As always, these are available both on our blog and via e-mail:&nbsp;<a href="http://eepurl.com/dhL_qb">Sign up to get the .NET Foundation Update via e-mail</a></p>

<h2>.NET Core 2.1 / ASP.NET Core 2.1 / EF Core 2.1 RTM</h2>

<p>.NET Core 2.1 was released&nbsp;at the end of May. Among other things, .NET Core includes some significant improvements for build time performance. We've seen many of you posting about how updating to .NET Core 2.1 has dramatically improved your build and runtime performance, which is great to hear! If you haven't read the release posts yet, here you go!</p>
