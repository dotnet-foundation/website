<p><a href="https://www.dotvvm.com/">DotVVM</a> is an MVVM framework for ASP.NET Core and OWIN. The DotVVM project has been under active development for almost 5 years. In addition to providing some nice productivity features through MVVM development and controls, it also offers an incremental upgrade path for ASP.NET Web Forms applications through the <a href="https://www.dotvvm.com/blog/48/Announcing-DotVVM-Adapters-for-ASP-NET-Web-Forms">DotVVM Adapter&nbsp;for ASP.NET WebForms</a>.</p>

<p>I first worked with&nbsp;Tomáš and the DotVVM team when they participated in the .NET Summer Hackfest in 2017. The DotVVM team really jumped in, hosting a <a href="https://www.dotvvm.com/blog/26/NET-Summer-Hackfest-Session-in-Prague">really productive in-person event with the PeachPie team in Prague</a>.&nbsp;</p>
