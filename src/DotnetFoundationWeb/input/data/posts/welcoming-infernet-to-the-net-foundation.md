<p><img alt="Infer.NET logo" src="assets/posts/infernet-icon.png" style="float: right; width: 186px; height: 211px;" />We're really excited to announce that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/the-microsoft-infer-net-machine-learning-framework-goes-open-source/">Infer.NET is joining the .NET Foundation</a>!</p>

<p>Infer.NET is model-based machine learning system for .NET, developed by Microsoft Research in Cambridge, UK. It's a mature and widely used system, as it's been developed since 2004, and is the machine learning engine in a number of Microsoft products in Office, Xbox and Azure. A recent example is&nbsp;TrueSkill 2&nbsp;– a system that matches players in online video games. Implemented in Infer.NET, it is running live in the bestselling titles Halo 5 and Gears of War 4, processing millions of matches.</p>

<p>But in an age of abundance of machine learning libraries, what sets Infer.NET apart from the competition? Great question, and well answered by the Infer.NET team's <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/the-microsoft-infer-net-machine-learning-framework-goes-open-source/">post</a> announcing they're joining the .NET Foundation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Infer.NET enables a model-based approach to machine learning. This lets you incorporate domain knowledge into your model. The framework can then build a bespoke machine learning algorithm directly from that model. This means that instead of having to map your problem onto a pre-existing learning algorithm that you’ve been given, Infer.NET actually constructs a learning algorithm for you, based on the model you’ve provided.</p>
