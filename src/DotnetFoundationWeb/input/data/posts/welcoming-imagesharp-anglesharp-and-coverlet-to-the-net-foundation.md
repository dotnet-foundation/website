<p>Today we welcome three projects to the .NET Foundation: <a href="https://sixlabors.com/projects/imagesharp/">ImageSharp</a>, <a href="https://anglesharp.github.io/">AngleSharp</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/tonerdo/coverlet">Coverlet</a>!</p>

<h2>ImageSharp</h2>

<p><a href="https://sixlabors.com/blog/imagesharp-joins-the-net-foundation/">ImageSharp</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;is a new, fully featured, fully managed, cross-platform, 2D graphics API. Designed to democratize image processing, ImageSharp brings you an incredibly powerful yet beautifully simple API. Compared to System.Drawing we have been able to develop something much more flexible, easier to code against, and much, much less prone to memory leaks. Gone are system-wide process-locks; ImageSharp images are thread-safe and fully supported in web environments.</p>

<h2>AngleSharp</h2>

<p>One thing the .NET ecosystem has been lacking for a while is a modern HTML5 parser. Furthermore, any other modern web tools have only been accessible via third-party (mostly native) applications (e.g., Selenium interop with a standard browser). AngleSharp tries to change this by bringing all the components for parsing, manipulating, and rendering current web applications. This includes evaluation of JavaScript and styling with CSS. The ambition of the project is to equip .NET developers with a toolbelt that is as complete as possible for all tasks in the web space.</p>

<h2>Coverlet</h2>

<p>Coverlet is a popular open source code coverage framework for .NET. It makes adding code coverage to your project fast and seamless and works on all platforms supported by the .NET Core SDK. Coverlet supports existing coverage reporting standards allowing it to be easily integrated with existing tools like IDEs and CI servers.</p>
