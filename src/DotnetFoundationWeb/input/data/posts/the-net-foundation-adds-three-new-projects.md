<p>Today the .NET Foundation welcomes three new projects:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Salesforce Toolkits for .NET</strong>, which enables .NET developers to interact with Salesforce's popular REST APIs from multiple Microsoft platforms, including .NET 4.5, Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8/8.1, as well as iOS/Android using Xamarin and Mono.NET.</li>
<li><strong>MVVM Light Toolkit</strong>, which helps .NET developers accelerate the creation and development of MVVM applications in WPF, Silverlight, Windows Store (RT) and for Windows Phone.</li>
<li><strong>Open XML SDK</strong>, a set of strongly-typed .NET classes that simplify the task of manipulating Open XML packages and the underlying Open XML schema elements within a package, enabling developers to perform complex operations with just a few lines of code.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are very pleased to have these projects under the stewardship of the .NET Foundation as part of our continued growth and evolution. Many people and projects have volunteered to participate and if you've submitted a project you'll be hearing from us soon.</p>
