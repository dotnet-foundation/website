<p>The .NET Foundation is happy to announce that OData is joining the .NET Foundation!<img alt="" src="assets/posts/ODataLogo-96.png" style="float: right; width: 97px; height: 96px;" /></p>

<p>OData (Open Data Protocol) is an ISO/IEC approved, OASIS standard that defines a set of best practices for building and consuming REST APIs.</p>

<p>OData enables the creation of REST-based services which allow resources identified using Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and defined in a data model, to be published and edited by Web clients using simple HTTP messages.</p>

<p>OData helps applications to focus on business logic without worrying about the various API approaches to define request and response headers, status codes, HTTP methods, URL conventions, media types, payload formats, query options, etc.</p>

<p>It provides guidance for tracking changes, defining functions/actions for reusable procedures, and sending asynchronous/batch requests.</p>

<p>OData improves semantic interoperability between systems and follows these design principles:</p>

<ul>
<li>Follow REST principles.</li>
<li>Keep it simple. Address the common cases and provide extensibility where necessary.</li>
<li>Build incrementally. A very basic, compliant service should be easy to build, with additional work necessary only to support additional capabilities.</li>
<li>Extensibility is important. Services should be able to support extended functionality without breaking clients unaware of those extensions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Moving the OData .NET libraries to the .NET Foundation recognizes the significant continuing contributions from the community, reaffirms Microsoftâ€™s commitment to those libraries, and makes it easier than ever for the community to engage in the ongoing support and evolution of those popular libraries.<br />
