<p>DevExpress&nbsp;joins a growing list of industry leaders in the .NET open source ecosystem who support the .NET Foundation as members, including Microsoft, Google, AWS, Red Hat, JetBrains, Unity, Samsung, Pivotal, Insight, and Telerik.</p>

<p>DevExpress&nbsp;has been an active contributor to the .NET ecosystem for years, and by joining the .NET Foundation they can become more deeply involved. They are also showing their support for the .NET open source community, as their financial contribution goes to support open source projects, worldwide Meetups, our member-run action groups, and new initiatives. The .NET Foundation will also benefit from their expertise as they help shape plans for future growth.</p>
