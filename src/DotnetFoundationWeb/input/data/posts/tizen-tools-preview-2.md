<p>Congratulations to .NET Foundation Technical Steering Group member Samsung who have just announced <a href="https://developer.tizen.org/development/preview">a new version of their tooling for .NET Developers</a> targeting the open source Tizen operating system which runs on over 50 million devices including TV's wearables and mobile phones. The new tooling has rich integration into Microsoft's Visual Studio environment including emulators TV as well as phone.</p>

<p>In this second preview, you can now use the familiar .NET Standard and Xamarin.Forms .NET API's to develop Tizen TV applications. Samsung Tizen TVs will begin shipping with .NET support once Visual Studio Tools for Tizen is officially released later in the year. The second preview also significantly increases the number of Tizen-specific APIs available for .NET developers such as Bluetooth, Smart Card, NFC, Map, Wi-Fi Direct, Telephony, Geofence Manager, and Account Service.</p>

<p>We're thrilled to see the great activity by Tizen developers from Samsung contributing to .NET Core and Xamarin.Forms along with the improvements to .NET support for Tizen that they have been contributing to the open source community.</p>
