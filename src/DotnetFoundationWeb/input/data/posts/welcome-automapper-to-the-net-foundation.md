<p><p>Please join me in welcoming AutoMapper to the .NET Foundation!</p><p><img src="assets/posts/automapper.png"></p><p>AutoMapper has been a popular library in the .NET open source community for a long time. As their site says: </p><p><em>AutoMapper is a simple little library built to solve a deceptively complex problem - getting rid of code that mapped one object to another. This type of code is rather dreary and boring to write, so why not invent a tool to do it for us?</em><p>Thanks to Jimmy Bogard and the AutoMapper team for building and actively maintaining this project for so many years! Welcome! <p>You can read more about AutoMapper, including some a nice <a href="https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper/wiki/Getting-started">getting started tutorial</a>, on <a href="http://automapper.org/">their site</a>.</p>
