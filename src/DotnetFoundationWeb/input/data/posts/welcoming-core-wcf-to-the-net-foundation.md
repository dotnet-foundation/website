<p>Today we're excited to support a new project announcement, Core WCF.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF">Core&nbsp;WCF</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;a new&nbsp;community owned OSS project&nbsp;under the .NET Foundation&nbsp;with&nbsp;its&nbsp;initial code donated from a WCF team member at Microsoft. Core WCF is not intending to be a 100% compatible port of WCF to .NET Core, but aims to allow porting of many WCF contract and service implementations with only a change of namespace.&nbsp;Initially,&nbsp;it will be for HTTP and TCP SOAP services on-top of Kestrel, which&nbsp;are&nbsp;the most commonly used transports on .NET Framework.&nbsp;This project is not yet&nbsp;ready&nbsp;for&nbsp;production but&nbsp;needs&nbsp;people to get involved and help&nbsp;get it there faster. If you are interested in this, or want more details about the project, then we encourage you to go and explore the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF">Core WCF project on&nbsp;GitHub</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For more context on how Core WCF fits in with the .NET 5 roadmap, see Scott Hunter's post on the .NET team blog, <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/supporting-the-community-with-wf-and-wcf-oss-projects/">Supporting the community with WF and WCF OSS projects</a>.</p>

<p>I think this is a great example of how the .NET Foundation can help coordinate&nbsp;.NET open source projects in a way that benefits the broader community. Microsoft reached out to us and said they&nbsp;could help contribute the beginning code for this project as well as some ongoing development support. We reached out to some .NET open source community leaders, and&nbsp;helped put together a team led by <a href="https://tibi.me/">Tibi Covaci</a>. Going forward, it's going to be helpful for this project to have the .NET Foundation's support services as they get off the ground.</p>

<p>Congrats to the team on their public launch, and looking forward to helping you build a successful project.</p>
