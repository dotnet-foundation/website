[ASP.NET Core](https://www.asp.net/core) is the next generation of ASP.NET that provides a familiar and modern framework for web and cloud scenarios. It includes the next versions of ASP.NET MVC, Web API, Web Pages and SignalR. It is a high-performance and modular design, and supports full side by side to make it seamless to migrate from on premise to the cloud. These products are actively developed by the ASP.NET team in collaboration with a community of open source developers. Together we are dedicated to creating the best possible platform for web development.
