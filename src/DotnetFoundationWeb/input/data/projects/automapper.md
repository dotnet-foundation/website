# AutoMapper

AutoMapper is a convention-based, object-to-object mapper. It replaces that boring object value copying code that's both tedious to write and test.

With straightforward conventions, AutoMapper removes hundreds or thousands of lines of code, enforcing a policy on your DTO design and making it simple to test your mappings.
