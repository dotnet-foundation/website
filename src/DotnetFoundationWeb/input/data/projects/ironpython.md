# DLR/IronPython2/IronPython3

[DLR](https://github.com/IronLanguages/dlr) is a framework for implementing dynamic languages on top of the .NET Framework. It is used as the basis for [IronPython2](https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironpython2) and [IronPython3](https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironpython3). It is licensed under the permissive [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/IronLanguages/dlr/blob/master/LICENSE) license.

[IronPython2](https://ironpython.net) is an implementation of the Python programming language running on the .NET Framework. IronPython2 implements compatibility with [Python 2.x](https://python.org). It is licensed under the permissive [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/IronLanguages/dlr/blob/master/LICENSE) license.

[IronPython3](https://ironpython.net) is an implementation of the Python programming language running on the .NET Framework. IronPython3 implements compatibility with [Python 3.x](https://python.org). It is licensed under the permissive [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/IronLanguages/dlr/blob/master/LICENSE) license.

Jim Hugunin created the project and actively contributed to it up until Version 1.0 which was released on September 5, 2006. Thereafter, it was maintained by a small team at Microsoft until the 2.7 Beta 1 release; Microsoft stopped internal development of IronPython in late 2010. IronPython 2.0 was released on December 10, 2008. The DLR, IronPython2 and IronPython3 are maintained by [Alex Earl](https://github.com/slide) and countless other contributors!
