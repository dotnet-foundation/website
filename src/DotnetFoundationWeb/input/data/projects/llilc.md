# LLILC

LLILC (pronounced 'lilac') is an **LL**VM based MS**IL C**ompiler. The goal of the project is to produce a set of .NET tools that utilize LLVM to reach a broad set of platforms and chip architectures. Today LLILC is being developed against [dotnet/CoreCLR](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr) for use as a JIT, but an ahead of time (AOT) compiler is planned for the future.
