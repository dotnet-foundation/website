# Microsoft Web Protection Library

The [Microsoft Web Protection Library (WPL)](https://wpl.codeplex.com/) is a set of .NET assemblies that help you protect your web sites. The WPL includes AntiXSS that provides a myriad of encoding functions for user input, including HTML, HTML attributes, XML, CSS and JavaScript. WPL also includes the Security Runtime Engine that provides a wrapper around your existing web sites, ensuring that common attack vectors do not make it to your application.
