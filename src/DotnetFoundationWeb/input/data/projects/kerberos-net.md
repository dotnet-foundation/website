# Kerberos.NET
A complete Kerberos library built entirely in managed code without (many) OS dependencies.

# What is it?

A library built in .NET that lets you operate on Kerberos messages. You can run a client, host your own KDC, or just validate incoming tickets. It's intended to be as lightweight as possible.
