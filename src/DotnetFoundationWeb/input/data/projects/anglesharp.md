# AngleSharp

[AngleSharp](https://anglesharp.github.io/) is a .NET Browser Engine Core, which represents the basis for modern web tooling available to .NET applications in form of a .NET Standard library. The library contains a fully implemented HTML5 parser and a dynamic DOM implementation that can be traversed using L4 query selectors. AngleSharp fully follows the W3C specification and WHATWG references to ensure a maximum compatibility with evergreen browsers.

AngleSharp's eco-system also features extension libraries such as an integrated CSS3 parser, XPath support, or an experimental JavaScript engine.

The long term vision for AngleSharp is provide all the building blocks for downloading, inspecting, running, and rendering standard web assets within .NET applications.
