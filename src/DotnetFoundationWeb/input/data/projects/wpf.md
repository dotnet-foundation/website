# Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)

[Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf) is a UI framework for building Windows desktop applications. 
WPF supports a broad set of application development features, including an application model, resources, controls, graphics, layout, 
data binding and documents. WPF uses the Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) to provide a declarative model for application 
programming.

WPF applications are based on a vector graphics architecture. This enables applications to look great on high DPI monitors, as they 
can be infinitely scaled. WPF also includes a flexible hosting model, which makes it straightforward to host a video in a button, 
for example. The visual designer provided in Visual Studio makes it easy to build WPF application, with drag-in-drop and/or direct 
editing of XAML markup.
