# NuGet Trends

[NuGet Trends](https://nugettrends.com/) holds historical data of NuGet packages download numbers. It's a useful tool for package maintainers to see the download rate of their packages and also for people interested in packages popularity over time. The database has the complete nuget.org catalog which include target framework information. That means that there's a lot more features we can add, like TFM adoption overtime, dependency graphs etc.
