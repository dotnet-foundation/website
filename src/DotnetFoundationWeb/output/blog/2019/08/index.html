<p><a href="https://dotnetfoundation.org/blog/2019/08/01/net-foundation-july-2019-update">Last month</a>, we told you how our Marketing team has moved to a new, open process for project news, and our Project Support team has moved to an open process for reviewing new project applications.<br />
<br />
This month, we've made some good progress on some additional action groups. Some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Outreach team (led by Sara Chipps) had a really productive kickoff call with volunteers around the world</li>
<li>The Membership (led by Iris Classon) worked to document our membership process so additional volunteers can get involved in processing applications. We also reviewed all outstanding membership applications, sent out invites, and fixed some technical issues people ran into while signing up. Finally, we improved our&nbsp;<a href="https://members.dotnetfoundation.org/">membership website</a>&nbsp;to explain membership a bit better, clean up the site design, and make it so anyone can clone and run the site locally to allow for content updates and improvements.</li>
<li>The Project&nbsp;team has some pretty exciting things in the works; we're hoping to announce at .NET Conf.</li>
</ul>

<h2>.NET Foundation Project Updates</h2>
<h3>IdentityModel v4 is released</h3>
<p>IdentityModel has been growing organically over the last years, and we felt it is necessary to do some fundamental cleanup. At the same time it is used by a lot of people and companies (currently around 20 million downloads on nuget) – which is a bit scary when doing breaking changes.</p>
<p>But since we are at a point where a new .NET Core runtime is released, and thus many other libraries will release new major version, we thought that this might be a good opportunity to make the changes.</p>
<p><strong>This version is a breaking release!!!</strong></p>
<p>Stay on v3.x if you are using:</p>
<ul>
<li>IdentityServer4 v2.x</li>
<li>IdentityServer4.AccessTokenValidation v2.x</li>
<li>IdentityModel.AspNetCore.OAuth2Introspection v3.x</li>
<li>IdentityModel.OidcClient v2.x</li>
</ul>
<p>All subsequent major versions of the above mentioned packages have switched to IdentityModel v4 and will be released along with IdentityServer4 v3 on the 23rd September.</p>
<p>In the coming days I will push IdentityModel v4 to nuget – here’s a high level list of the changes.</p>
<p><strong>Target frameworks</strong>&nbsp;I dropped the net452 target – v4 is targeting net461 and netstandard2.0 only.</p>
<p><strong>Removed old&nbsp;<code>*Client</code>&nbsp;classes</strong>&nbsp;I removed the protocol client classes like&nbsp;<code>TokenClient</code>&nbsp;in favour of the newer style extension methods for HttpMessageInvoker (the base class of HttpClient). This allows you to manage the setup and lifetime of the HTTP client yourself. I added a new&nbsp;<code>TokenClient</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>IntrospectionClient</code>&nbsp;based on the new design which is now DI and&nbsp;<code>HttpClientFactory</code>&nbsp;friendly. I did that mainly because I needed them in some other project. Give them a try, and see if they work for you as well.</p>
<p><strong>Removed access token related delegating handlers for&nbsp;<code>HttpClient</code></strong>&nbsp;I never was happy with their design, and they also did not work for some common scenarios. Part of the work has been moved to&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/IdentityModel/IdentityModel.OidcClient2">OidcClient</a>&nbsp;(for native apps) and part of it has been moved to the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/IdentityModel/IdentityModel.AspNetCore">ASP.NET Core specific IdentityModel</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Updated extension methods</strong>&nbsp;The protocol extensions methods have been re-written from the ground up. The public API surface stayed mostly the same, but certain classes have been renamed for clarity. The request objects now derive from&nbsp;<code>HttpRequestMessage</code>&nbsp;which gives you more control over the HTTP details (e.g. headers).</p>
<p><strong>Updated Epoch Extensions</strong>&nbsp;Year 2038 is coming! All extensions have been updated to use long instead of int. Alternatively – .NET has built-in support now as well. So feel free to switch to that if you like.</p>
<p><strong>Misc</strong>&nbsp;I probably changed some parameter, classes and namespace names..</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.chem4word.co.uk/">Chemistry Add-In for Word (Chem4Word)</a></h3>
<p>It seems like it's all gone quiet on Chem4Word recently, but we've been working&nbsp;<em>extremely</em>&nbsp;hard on addressing some licensing concerns.&nbsp;<em>Chem4Word</em>&nbsp;is currently released under the Apache 2.0 license, but its structure 'sketcher' is a 3rd-party product which uses GPL. We've muddled through up to now because the editor is dyamically linked. But we'd also really like to get our entire code base under the .NET Foundation umbrella.</p>
<p>So we've been writing a new sketcher - the&nbsp;<em>Advanced CML-based Molecule Editor</em>&nbsp;(or ACME for short). It's written in C# and uses Windows Presentation Foundation for its graphics. It can be used as a drop-in structure editor for any Windows Forms or WPF application.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.chem4word.co.uk/"><img alt="" src="assets/posts/d0116177-1422-43c8-a2a8-be355cea03f2.png" /></a></p>
<p>Having our own editor also means we have&nbsp;complete control&nbsp;over what we can and can't edit in CML. This means we can add new features much more easily. And keep our users happy!</p>
<p>We should soon have ACME ready for beta-testing. The team members who have worked incredibly hard on this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Joe Townsend</li>
<li>Mike Williams</li>
<li>Andy Wright</li>
</ul>
<p>If anyone fancies beta-testing ACME then you can drop me a line (<a href="mailto:clyde.davies&#64;gmail.com">clyde.davies&#64;gmail.com</a>). All offers of help gratefully received!</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Adapter-Release-Notes#nunit3-test-adapter-for-visual-studio---version-315---august-23-2019">NUnit 3 Test Adapter 3.15</a></h3>
<p>Versions 3.14 and 3.15 were both released this month. Changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A performance boost when running a fraction of the tests by using a test discovery prefilter (thanks Matthew Beardmore!)</li>
<li>The working directory is changed to the temp folder when VSTest starts with the current directory inside&nbsp;<code>C:\Windows</code>&nbsp;or Program Files.</li>
<li><code>TestContext.Progress</code>&nbsp;only goes to the console now and not the test output.</li>
<li>Engine extensions are now loaded by the adapter, enabling scenarios such as mixing NUnit and xUnit tests in the same run (thanks Nikolay Borisenko!)</li>
</ul>
<p>ℹ NUnit Test Adapter 3.15 has uncovered some less-common bugs in NUnit Framework that must be fixed in a new NUnit Framework release. To preserve compatibility with older versions of NUnit Framework, NUnit Test Adapter 3.15.1 (releasing soon) will make the prefilter opt-in via runsettings.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/AdapterV2-Release-Notes#nunit-test-adapter-for-visual-studio---version-220---june-5-2019">NUnit 2 Test Adapter 2.2</a>&nbsp;was available last month with bugfixes and with a VSIX that supports Visual Studio 2019.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/nunit/dotnet-new-nunit/releases/tag/v1.6.3">NUnit dotnet CLI template 1.6.3</a>&nbsp;features dependency updates and an F# template improvement (thanks zanaptak!)</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/releases/tag/v3.0.0-beta1">Orleans 3.0.0-beta1</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Major improvements
<ul>
<li>Replaced networking stack with the Bedrock layer of ASP.NET Core</li>
<li>Support for future wire protocol versioning</li>
<li>A series of improvements in cluster recovery from node failures</li>
<li>Pluggable data adapters for EventHub stream provider</li>
<li>Compatibility with .NET Core 3.0</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This release is backward compatible, over the wire messaging wise, with 2.* releases, which allows for in-place upgrade of a running cluster. However, there are several breaking changes in the APIs that might require minor adjustments for application code to compile.</p>
<p>We measured significant performance gains with this release over 2.* versions, ranging from 8% to 93% depending on the test, mostly due to the network stack rewrite.</p>
<hr />
<h3><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/releases/tag/v2.4.0">Orleans 2.4.0</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/releases/tag/v2.4.1">2.4.1</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Major improvements
<ul>
<li>Reduced reliance on cluster membership table and speed up clustering convergence by sending versioned snapshots of the table as part of gossip messages</li>
<li>Configurable transactional state roles to support cases when a transactional state cannot be transaction manager</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This release is backward compatible with 2.0.* releases, which allows for in-place upgrade of a running cluster.</p>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/projects/projects/1">Project Onboarding Process Improvements</a></h2>
<p>Project onboarding is now handled publicly via GitHub issues. The process is now more transparent and visible. Progress through the process is easily visualized via a&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/projects/projects/1">GitHub project board</a>.</p>
<p>This is part of our effort to move to open processes so action groups and community members can more easily participate. The previous process was buried in emails and word documents and lacked visibility and transpancey.</p>
<p>We have an issue template for new project applications here:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/projects/issues/new/choose">https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/projects/issues/new/choose</a></p>
<p>Key goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear status to projects</li>
<li>Use milestones and labels to batch up applications into monthly review cycles</li>
<li>Enable action group members to review and help out on applications</li>
<li>Comments / pull requests / etc. are welcome.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Join an Action Group!</h2>
<p>We recently&nbsp;<a href="https://dotnetfoundation.org/blog/2019/05/31/net-foundation-may-2019-update">announced our new Action Groups</a>: a way for .NET Foundation members to join teams and get directly involved in helping the .NET Foundation scale to the next level. Our teams include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communications</li>
<li>Corporate Relations</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
<li>Membership</li>
<li>Outreach</li>
<li>Project Support</li>
<li>Speakers and Meetups</li>
<li>Technical Review</li>
</ul>
<p>We've been figuring out logistics and communications as we move to working publicly and with a large team. We've settled on&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/dotnet-foundation">GitHub Organizational Teams</a>&nbsp;and are continuing to roll this out to the teams - we've mostly started with Marketing and Project Support so far, but are now working on getting other groups more involved in our day to day business.<br />

<h2>.NET Foundation Project Updates</h2>
<h3><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-ml-net-1-2-and-model-builder-updates-machine-learning-for-net/">ML.NET 1.2 released</a></h3>
<p>ML.NET 1.2 and updates to Model Builder and the CLI were released on early July 2019. ML.NET is an open-source and cross-platform machine learning framework for .NET developers. ML.NET also includes Model Builder (a simple UI tool for Visual Studio) and the ML.NET CLI (Command-line interface) to make it super easy to build custom Machine Learning (ML) models using Automated Machine Learning (AutoML). Using ML.NET, developers can leverage their existing tools and skill-sets to develop and infuse custom ML into their applications by creating custom machine learning models for common scenarios like Sentiment Analysis, Price Prediction, Image Classification and more!</p>
<p>The following are some of the key highlights in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>General availability of TimeSeries support for forecasting and anomaly detection</li>
<li>General availability of ML.NET packages to use TensorFlow and ONNX models</li>
<li>Easily integrate ML.NET models in web or serverless apps with Microsoft.Extensions.ML integration package</li>
<li>MLNET CLI and Model Builder for Visual Studio were updated with multiple improvements</li>
</ul>

<img src="assets/posts/B7MGXhhb_400x400.png" style="float: right; height: 128px; width: 128px;" /></h3>
<p>Version 0.34.0 has several features, improvements and bug fixes, full details in the linked blog post but a few highlights in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved MSBuild 16 (VS2019) tool resolution</li>
<li>Update to Roslyn version 3.0.0</li>
<li>Updated to NuGet client version 5</li>
<li>NuGet pack support for several new nuspec elements</li>
</ul>
<p>Version 0.34.1 is just a minor release as a hotfix to address an issue breaking scripts when the dynamic C# keyword was used in build scripts. This was a side effect of updating from Roslyn 2.x to 3.x.</p>
<p>🎉&nbsp;We're also happy to share that Cake turned five years old this May! And we've just done our 100th Cake release!&nbsp;🎉<br />
Huge thanks to our contributors and users! Wouldn't have been possible without your support! ❤</p>

<p>Did you know that DotVVM can be used to incrementally modernize old ASP.NET Web Forms applications and lift them to .NET Core? It is much easier than doing a full rewrite, and the application can be deployed at any time during the entire process.</p>
<ul>
<li>Install DotVVM NuGet package in your Web Forms site</li>
<li>Create a DotVVM master page using the same CSS</li>
<li>Start converting ASPX pages to DotHTML syntax, one at a time</li>
<li>When all the Web Forms pages are gone, change your CSPROJ to use .NET Core</li>
</ul>
<p>We have created some useful resources that will help you in this process.</p>

            <p>Earlier this month, I (Jon Galloway) attended and spoke at <a href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or/public/schedule/detail/75936">OSCON</a> (Portland, July 16-18), representing the .NET Foundation.</p>
<p>TLDR:</p>

<h3>Presentation: Why you should care about open source software foundations</h3>
<p>(<a href="https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/en/assets/1/event/295/Why%20you%20should%20care%20about%20open%20source%20software%20foundations%20_sponsored%20by%20Microsoft_%20Presentation.pptx">slide download</a>, 2 minute video on <a href="https://twitter.com/jongalloway/status/1152009213775757315">this tweet</a>)</p>
<p>In two years of supporting the .NET Foundation, I continue to see that developers are generally aware that open source software foundations (like the Linux Foundation, Apache Foundation, Eclipse Foundation, and .NET Foundation) exist, but have no idea why. That’s unfortunate, because foundations are really important for the entire open source ecosystem, including contributors, project leaders, consumers, businesses who depend on open source, pretty much everyone in software development. I’ve been giving a talk on what the .NET Foundation does at .NET related conferences over the past few years; at OSCON I broadened this to a more general “why are foundations a thing” talk, with .NET Foundation as a more of a case study.</p>
<p><strong>My high level generalization is that open source software foundations exist to make sure the projects you care about stay around and thrive.</strong>*</p>
<p>There are different foundations, with different focuses based on the communities they serve. The .NET Foundation has an interesting challenge, in that it supports both projects contributed by a trillion dollar company as well as projects that are broadly used but are developed by tiny teams.</p>
<p>For the tiny team scenario, I show the following <a href="http://www.commitstrip.com/en/2014/05/07/the-truth-behind-open-source-apps/">comic</a> in my slides (used with permission):</p>
<p><img src="assets/posts/the-truth-about-open-source.jpg" style="height:864px; width:598px" /></p>
<p><em>Source:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.commitstrip.com/en/2014/05/07/the-truth-behind-open-source-apps/">http://www.commitstrip.com/en/2014/05/07/the-truth-behind-open-source-apps/</a></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the case of projects contributed and primarily developed by Microsoft, the .NET Foundation serves other purposes, like facilitating collaboration with thousands of companies and individual contributors worldwide through independent licensing, CLA support, legal, etc.</p>
<p>So my high level outline for this presentation is:</p>
<ul>
<li>.NET is really open source, and it’s really worked for us</li>
<li>Open source software foundations exist to make sure the projects you care about stay around and thrive</li>
<li>.NET Foundation as a case study
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>What we’ve been doing since 2014: project support, Meetups, events like .NET Conf</li>
<li>What we’re doing now to scale up: community elections, Action Groups</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A quick look at some other foundations and what they do that’s unique to their communities
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li><a href="http://chooseafoundation.com/">http://chooseafoundation.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://opensource.com/resources/organizations">https://opensource.com/resources/organizations</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_free_and_open-source_software_organizations">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_free_and_open-source_software_organizations</a> (there are legion)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Get involved!
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>Projects: join a foundation</li>
<li>Developers, business people, everyone: support your foundations</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The reception was good, and questions indicated people got it. Also nice was that both lawyers from the .NET Foundation’s outside legal counsel team (external to Microsoft, as .NET Foundation is a separate non-profit corporation) were there. We went to lunch after the presentation, and they both said that this really helped them understand what we’re doing and what’s unique about the .NET open source community a lot better.</p>
<p>This session was filmed, but I believe they’re just making the video available to paid attendees. I’d be happy to record and post a version if desired.</p>
<p><i>*Saying that open source software foundations exist to keep projects sustainable is a bit of an over-generalization. For instance, some foundations exist to advocate for viewpoints like free software, open web (Mozilla), etc. But, baby steps, I’m happy to start with a generalization when most people I talk to want the 101 level intro.</i></p>
<hr align="center" size="1" width="100%" />
<h3>Open Source Foundation networking</h3>
<p>I had a lot of really good conversations with leaders of open source foundations. It’s just generally good for everyone to be aware of .NET as a “real” open source thing™, but there were two standout interactions:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The Open Source Initiative (OSI):</b> These folks were an exceptionally friendly bunch, and recommended that the .NET Foundation join the OSI as an affiliate member. I’ve since reviewed their requirements and published information and have started the application process. It'll need to go through both&nbsp;boards for approval, but at a high level this sounds really good to me.</li>
<li><b>GNOME Foundation:</b> Our recent governance model restructuring to a community elected board was heavily influenced by the GNOME Foundation’s model. It was nice to check in with them, talk to their executive director for a while, and hear what works for them organizationally.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Tidelift conversation</h3>
<p>I had a long discussion with Luis, a co-founder at&nbsp;<a href="https://tidelift.com/">Tidelift</a>. We’ve chatted before via Twitter and&nbsp;e-mail, but their business model is complex enough that it was much more effective to talk in person.</p>
<p>Tidelift offers a “managed open source subscription backed by creators and maintainers”. Luis is a lawyer with a long history in open source, and he’s been working to think through how to offer a subscription model that benefits both open source projects and sponsors. Here’s the idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Companies that use open source software sign on for a subscription</li>
<li>Tidelift scans their software to help them determine what they’re using (note: according to Luis, when companies guess at supporting open source projects, it can come down to well marketed projects, who the CTO follows on Twitter, etc.; actually analyzing dependency trees reveals building block packages that they may be relying on heavily without knowing it)</li>
<li>Tidelift builds a relationship with open source projects to set up support plans. Projects need to have things like defined security vulnerability reporting plans, support structure, etc., and in exchange Tidelift gives them a usage based share of their monthly subscription revenue.</li>
<li>Some of the subscription revenue supports paid development for issues requested by sponsoring companies.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: This is my quick summary from an in-person conversation, and it's likely it's not exactly precise. I recommend reading the content <a href="https://tidelift.com/">on the Tidelift site</a> to make sure you get the real scoop.</em></p>
<p>It’s an interesting model that aims to connect the dots between companies using open source software and under-funded open source projects. While at some point we may want to look at a bigger, organizational level agreement, I think we’ll start by offering an introduction to .NET open source community projects that are interested. Also, Luis knows everyone in this space, so it was nice just hanging around at their booth for an hour or so and meeting all the open source legal people who came by to chat. :-)</p>
<hr align="center" size="1" width="100%" />
<h3>Attended Session Highlights</h3>
<p>I attended some informative sessions, with a focus on open source governance and community. Some highlights:</p>
<p><a href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or/public/schedule/detail/75954">FOSS governance: The good, the bad, and the ugly</a> (Deb Nicholson, Software Freedom Conservancy)</p>
<p>This was an informative, and highly entertaining, overview of open source project best and worst practices. My main takeaway was that open source project teams and practices often organically evolve, and aren’t objectively evaluated to see what’s working and what can be improved. Deb pointed out a lot of things, like shared vision, documented processes, and plans for dealing with hostile leaders, that are worth stepping back and thinking about.</p>
<p><a href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or/public/schedule/detail/75936">Building and maintaining open source communities</a> (panel)</p>
<p>Great stuff at this panel! Some top tips from leaders that have built effective open source communities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on and improve onboarding experience</li>
<li>Look for your top contributors (“one percenters”) and really support them</li>
<li>Watch for signs of burnout, especially in your 1%ers</li>
<li>Ask them what problems they’re facing and what they’re most proud of</li>
<li>Rotate through administrative roles</li>
<li>Have community awards</li>
<li>For open source projects associated with a company, make corp leaders aware that you’re building and spending community capital. A corporate misstep can spend years of capital the team has been building.</li>
<li>Document everything, especially succession plans</li>
<li>Metrics - agree with management on goals, tie in to corporate goals</li>
<li>Don't focus on code, focus on needs of community</li>
</ul>
<hr align="center" size="1" width="100%" />
<p>We also gave away some stickers, and I popped in at the Microsoft table to talk to .NET developers as they stopped by.</p>
<p>Overall, this was a valuable conference to attend. It was really good to continue to publicize open source .NET and the .NET Foundation, make connections with other foundation leaders, and learn tips that have been effective in building open source communities.</p>
