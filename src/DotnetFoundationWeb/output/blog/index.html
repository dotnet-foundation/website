            <p>Here's the February/March 2020 .NET Foundation update. Every month, we'll give you a quick overview of the .NET Open Source landscape, including top project news, events, community links and more.</p>
<h2 id="general-news">General news</h2>
<p>The Board voted to tie our <a href="https://dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct">code of conduct</a> to always be based on the latest version of the contributor covenant. We had been at <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/3/0/code-of-conduct/">1.3</a>, and now we're on <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/">2.0</a>. Member projects are expected adopt this update promptly. Projects that directly reference our version are all set and we encourage maintainers to review the docs to understand its contents.</p>
<h3 id="update-on-board-elections">Update on Board Elections</h3>
<p>We’re postponing our board elections as we work through the transition to our new Executive Director. We are also in the process of hiring a company to help the .NET Foundation administration and want to make sure this is in place before we solicit candidates. The .NET Foundation by-laws do not require an exact date to hold elections and the current Board decided to get streamlined processes in place before the next set of members are elected so that they will be set up for a successful year ahead.</p>
<p>As always, these are available both on our blog and via e-mail: <a href="http://eepurl.com/dhL_qb">Sign up to get the .NET Foundation Update via e-mail</a></p>
<h2 id="committee-updates">Committee Updates</h2>
<p>The board approved the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/projects">Projects charter</a> that details what we look for in member projects looking to join, and expectations of member projects once approved. If you have feedback/changes/discussion on specific areas, please open an issue (to discuss) or PR (to propose specific changes).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-marketing">marketing committee</a> just had their meeting update to all members and discussed how you can get involved. There are some jobs they have available and are accepting nominations to the committee. They also went over the proposed .NET Brand book with positive feedback and hope to release it to the community soon. See the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-marketing/blob/master/Meetings/2020-Mar-05/README.md">meeting notes</a> for details, deck and recording.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-outreach">outreach committee</a> is having their first monthly meeting Tuesday 3/17 at 12p EST. You can join via this <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_OWFiZTQ0NTAtMmE0OS00NTdiLWIzODAtZjk0YjcwM2Y4MGQ0%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2216076fdc-fcc1-4a15-b1ca-32c9a255900e%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%223ab57283-2fae-42fe-b673-fa33c1e6e46a%22%7d">link</a>. The group will meet every third Tuesday of the month on Teams. This first meeting will be to discuss the format for submitting projects, the goals of the committee, and talk through the process of building working groups and requesting resources.</p>
<h2 id="events">Events</h2>
<p><a href="https://focus.dotnetconf.net">.NET Conf: Focus on Xamarin</a> virtual event is coming to you on March 23! This is a free, one-day livestream event that features speakers from the community and .NET product teams that are working on building native mobile apps with Xamarin technology! Xamarin lets you build native mobile apps for Android and iOS with C# instead of Java and Swift.</p>

<h3 id="jetbrains-net-day-online-2020-call-for-speakers">JetBrains .NET Day Online 2020 - Call for Speakers</h3>
<p>One of our Technical Steering Group members is organizing the second <strong>JetBrains .NET Day Online on May 14, 2020</strong>. It's a free, virtual event, where community speakers cover topics they are passionate about, ranging from deep technical .NET content and speakers' experiences with specific tools and technologies to personal development.</p>
<p>Right now, they are looking for speakers interested in presenting with them! JetBrains is looking for .NET topics that are relevant to a broader audience, ideally with a link to JetBrains tools like ReSharper, Rider, and the profiling tools (though this is not required).</p>
<p>For more information, <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2020/02/13/jetbrains-net-day-online-2020-call-speakers/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=resharper&amp;utm_content=dnf2020-02">head over to the Call for Speakers page</a>!</p>

<td><strong>Kereberos.NET</strong><br />
Kerberos.NET is a managed implementation of the Kerberos authentication protocol used by the majority of production enterprise platforms. Hundreds of millions of enterprise Windows clients authenticate using Kerberos every day but there are noticeable gaps in how these clients seamlessly authenticate to cloud services. This library is intended to bridge those gaps between Windows on-premises model with hybrid cloud services without taking a dependency on any platform.</td>

<td><strong>Nerdbank.Gitversioning</strong><br />
This package adds precise, semver-compatible git commit information to every assembly, VSIX, NuGet and NPM package, and more. It implicitly supports all cloud build services and CI server software because it simply uses git itself and integrates naturally in MSBuild, gulp and other build scripts.</td>

<td><strong>Nuget Trends</strong><br />
NuGet Trends holds historical data of NuGet packages download numbers. It's a useful tool for package maintainers to see the download rate of their packages and also for people interested in packages popularity over time. The database has the complete nuget.org catalog which include target framework information. That means that there's a lot more features we can add like TFM adoption overtime, dependency graphs etc.</td>

<td><strong>Marten</strong><br />
Marten gives developers a multi-paradigm framework for modelling, storing and querying data on PostgreSQL. Making use of the battle hardened database engine, Marten transparently exposes the JSON(B) capabilities of PostgreSQL for managing objects and events alike, requiring no ceremony to enable friction-less development. Marten is your object (document) and event store, with bells and whistles attached, be it CRUD, Event Sourcing or anything between.</td>

<td><strong>CoreWF</strong><br />
The Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) handles the long-running work of many companies. It powers many applications in all types of businesses. As more developers look into adopting .NET Core, some are asking if WF will be officially ported. This project only ports the WF runtime and ETW tracking provider to the .NET Standard. But much more work is needed before it can substitute for the .NET Framework version.</td>

<td><strong>linq2db</strong><br />
LINQ to DB is the fastest LINQ database access library offering a simple, light, fast, and type-safe layer between your POCO objects and your database. Architecturally it is one step above micro-ORMs like Dapper, Massive, or PetaPoco, in that you work with LINQ expressions, not with magic strings, while maintaining a thin abstraction layer between your code and the database. Your queries are checked by the C# compiler and allow for easy refactoring. However, it's not as heavy as LINQ to SQL or Entity Framework. There is no change-tracking, so you have to manage that yourself, but on the positive side you get more control and faster access to your data. In other words LINQ to DB is type-safe SQL.</td>

<h3><a href="https://nunit.org/" rel="nofollow">NUnit</a></h3>
<p>This month brought releases for two of our projects:</p>
<p><strong>NUnit VSTest Adapter 3.16.0</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Adapter-Release-Notes#nunit3-test-adapter-for-visual-studio---version-3160---january-3-2020">release notes</a>) and <strong>3.16.1</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Adapter-Release-Notes#nunit3-test-adapter-for-visual-studio---version-3161---january-16-2020">release notes</a>). Major changes in 3.16:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Support has been removed for .NET Core 1.* which is no longer supported by Microsoft. If you do have .NET Core 1.* solutions and can't upgrade, you should stay with version 3.15.1 or lower of the adapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The filter syntax issues we've had with special names and characters have been mostly solved thanks to excellent work by <a href="https://github.com/johnmwright">John M. Wright</a>. See <a href="https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/pull/668">PR 668</a> for a detailed explanation of what has been done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now use the NUnit filter syntax, either from command line or through settings in the runsettings file. The idea and implementation were provided by <a href="https://github.com/mletterle">Michael Letterle</a> who wrote a <a href="http://blog.prokrams.com/2019/12/16/nunit3-filter-dotnet/" rel="nofollow">great blogpost</a> to explain how this works and how he arrived at the solution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NUnit Console and Engine 3.11</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Console-Release-Notes#nunit-console-311---january-26-2020">release notes</a>). This release fixes a range of minor bugs and includes a significant amount of internal restructuring work. In future, this will enable improved .NET Standard support in the engine and a .NET Core build of the console.</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly">Polly</a></h3>
<p>From the Polly community this month:</p>
<p>Updates to <strong>Simmy</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/Polly-Contrib/Simmy">github</a>; <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Polly.Contrib.Simmy" rel="nofollow">nuget</a>), our sister project for <strong>chaos-engineering integrated with Polly</strong>. Version 0.3 released:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Fluent-builder syntax for easier configuration</li>
<li>.NET Core 3.1 support</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Polly.Contrib.DuplicateRequestCollapser</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/Polly-Contrib/Polly.Contrib.DuplicateRequestCollapser">github</a>; <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Polly.Contrib.DuplicateRequestCollapser/" rel="nofollow">nuget</a>): a new Polly policy to <a href="https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/wiki/Avoiding-cache-repopulation-request-storms">avoid downstream request storms</a> when repopulating expensive cache items in high-throughput systems. <code>Polly.Contrib.DuplicateRequestCollapser</code> <a href="https://github.com/Polly-Contrib/Polly.Contrib.DuplicateRequestCollapser/blob/master/README.md">collapses concurrent duplicate requests into a single downstream call</a>.</p>

        <div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>I started as .NET Foundation Executive Director in February 2017, and a lot has happened over the past nearly three years. We’ve added dozens of&nbsp;high quality&nbsp;projects and added a lot of services to support them, like automated code signing and releases. We launched a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.meetup.com/pro/dotnet">worldwide Meetup program</a>&nbsp;that includes over a quarter of a million&nbsp;members, and&nbsp;supported them with hundreds of local events in our .NET Conf Local series. We’ve also ushered in substantial changes, literally years in the making, to&nbsp;open up&nbsp;membership, run an election for the board’s first elected directors, introduce a corporate sponsorship program, and lay the groundwork for the .NET Foundation to grow into its next stage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I first signed on to work full time on the .NET Foundation, the plan was for that to be a&nbsp;two year&nbsp;secondment; it’s been almost three years. I was recently offered a role with a product group in Microsoft that will offer some new opportunities and challenges that are&nbsp;pretty exciting&nbsp;to me.&nbsp;And also, after almost three years at the .NET Foundation, I really feel like some fresh perspective and energy in the Executive Director role can help us get to the next stage. It’s time for me to step down as Executive Director. However, I will still be helping the community as Vice President of the .NET Foundation and as a member of the voluntary Advisory Council.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m very happy to announce that we have an obvious choice for the next Executive Director, Oren Novotny. Oren was a member of the Advisory Council when I first started back in 2017, but it didn’t take long for me to learn that he was a lot more than “just” and Advisory Council member. Oren had set up a lot of the systems that the .NET Foundation depended on, from continuous build systems for projects to Azure and Office 365 backend admin to deeply technical issues like security and code signing systems for projects. Month in and out, he’s volunteered tons of time, both on support for individual projects and bigger picture initiatives that benefitted all our projects, and the open source community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oren is widely respected in the .NET open source community, so it was no surprise to me when he was elected in our first board elections this year. Since then, he’s both shown leadership and vision as a director and continued to push ahead on project support and technical initiatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll be transitioning duties to Oren over the next few weeks, with Oren officially taking over at the start of January. Over the next few weeks we will transition roles, but since he was the one who showed me the ropes on a lot of our operations when I first started, this won’t be a tricky transition at all. Please give him a great welcome and offer him all the help and assistance you can. I wish Oren all the&nbsp;best, and&nbsp;am excited to see him take the .NET Foundation to the next level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to thank the .NET community for their support and passion over the past few years. I’ve always believed the community is who shows up: there’s a big difference between talking about what someone should do and&nbsp;actually getting&nbsp;involved when there’s an opportunity or need. A great example is the turnout for our board member elections earlier this year. We’d worried about what to do if fewer than six people ran for the six open seats; we ended up with forty-five amazing candidates. Time after time, you’ve offered suggestions on what we could do better, pitched in on new initiatives, and helped us grow up as a Foundation and an open source community. I’m looking forward to continuing to work with you and to helping in my Vice President role. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>--&nbsp;Jon&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few words from Oren as he steps into this role:&nbsp;</p>
<p>My journey in the .NET open source community began around 2012 as I published some helper libraries to GitHub. My reasoning was then, and continues to be, “if it’s useful to me, someone else will probably find it useful too.” I have been privileged to work with an amazing group of talented project maintainers, including&nbsp;xUnit, Humanizer, Reactive Extensions, the Windows Community Toolkit, and NuGet Package Explorer. Over the past seven years, I’ve strived to find and fill gaps in libraries and tools to enable people to focus on building great things. In the role of Executive Director of the .NET Foundation, I look forward to helping support our existing projects and as well as growing our thriving ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am deeply humbled by the responsibility placed upon me as the Foundation’s new Executive Director. Over the next couple of months, as I ramp up, I intend to reach out and do a lot of listening. The mission of the Foundation is to foster innovation, open development, and collaboration for community and commercial developers to strengthen the future of the .NET ecosystem. I want to hear from you--your thoughts on how the Foundation is doing in its mission, what works and what doesn’t, and how we can improve. Our industry moves very quickly and what worked yesterday may not always be the thing that works best tomorrow. With a diversity of thoughts, we can forge a path forward toward a stronger .NET ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;Oren&nbsp;</p>
