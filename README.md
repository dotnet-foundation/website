# dotnetfoundation- an amazing website

This repository contains the solution that is used to build and deploy the [dotnetfoundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org/) website.

Pull requests and issues are delightfully welcome!

## Prerequisites

* Git: Clone this repository to make a change.
* [.NET Core SDK 3.1.\*](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
* Optional: [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for editing.

## Build and test

The basic steps to run or build the project are as follows:

1. Use `dotnet run` from the root of the repository to generate the static site.
1. After the build, check the `output` folder to review the generated HTML files.

To build and preview the site, run:

 ```
 dotnet run -- preview
 ```
 
The preceding command launches a preview web server that can be viewed from http://localhost:5080. The site automatically rebuilds and refreshes when content changes are made.

## Project Structure

This website uses [Statiq Web](https://github.com/statiqdev/Statiq.Web), a flexible and extensible static site generator for .NET.
