# .NET Foundation Campaign: Jerome Hardaway

## Who am I?

I am a Google Developer Expert (Web), Twilio Champion, Developer Advocate for Quicken Loans, Javascript Engineer and Geek At Arms (Founder and Executive Director) of Vets Who Code, a 501(c)3 veteran-led charitable non-profit dedicated to filling the nationâ€™s technical skills gap with early-stage transitioning veterans and military spouses through remote software development training. 

## Why I'm Running

I'm running because as I grow within my own journey of being a forever student of programming, I see places where my military and leadership experience can add value to make the community more inclusive. When I first started helping U.S. Veterans the question was asked to me, " Can veterans even learn how to code?" and now six years later I have personally heralded 250 veterans into the industry, using code. I've done that with Javascript and now, I intend to use .Net as a tool to continue the mission of creating pathways for veterans and others that are underrepresented in tech to navigate the journey and become programmers by being a boots on the ground leader within the foundation. I used Javascript to earn the nickname of "Captain America of the Web" and it has been my shield, but as I ask for more from myself to help more people my mission is to use C# and .Net as Mjolnir to show others who don't come from the common paths of tech that they are in fact, worthy.
