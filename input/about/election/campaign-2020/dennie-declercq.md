# Why I’m Running

## *#DreamingIsBelieving continues… With this awesome nomination…*
I am Dennie Declercq and a strong ally for inclusion and tech for people with disabilities. Have you ever considered that 1B people in the world have a disability? A disability that is visible or invisible. I am an advocate and strong ally for people with disabilities. I believe in digital inclusion in the broadest sense. 


### If something doesn’t go right, go left! Think outside the box!

I have a background as a person with autism. I did it my way (the #DreamingIsBelieving way). At this time I am president of my own nonprofit DDSoft in Belgium, 2 years Microsoft MVP Developer Technologies and volunteer in a coaching center for people with a cognitive disability (Ithaka), and spoke at a lot of conferences from Sydney to Orlando.

*... How far can the dream go?*

# My .NET Contributions
My biggest focus is telling the people at conferences about people with disabilities in the broadest sense. Talks as: **“The Power of Inclusion”**, **“Autism in Tech”**, **“Making Accessible Apps in Xamarin”** are just some of my success stories.
I also **work, engineer** *pure voluntary* on **accessible Xamarin Apps** and *just started* to explore what **AI can do for the better (life of people with disabilities)**.
So to conclude, thought leadership, vision work and tech research for the people that need it most.
