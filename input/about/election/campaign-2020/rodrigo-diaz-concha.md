# .NET Foundation Campaign: Rodrigo Díaz Concha


## Why I'm Running
I'm running because **I care about .NET, its present and its future.** I'm entirely convinced that **.NET is the best development platform to build any type of software solution.** The involvement and opinion of the whole community are essential to guide this fabulous technology's development efforts.

I'm a .NET developer since the first beta of version 1.0 in 2001. I started with Visual Basic .NET and later adopted C# as a programming language to build business and enterprise applications. Nowadays, I architect and develop software solutions with .NET for different verticals (mainly Telemedicine and Retail); because of this, I consider that .NET and its future are transcendental to continue building software that improves people's lives.

I'm a Microsoft Regional Director, and for 12 consecutive years, I have been recognized as a Microsoft MVP. It has been a long journey, but without a doubt, my professional success is primarily due to .NET.

I've been traveling around all Latin America for over a decade, and I know the pain points and struggles that Microsoft has gotten from the communities, businesses, and government institutions that don't consider .NET their first technology choice.  I want to change over and strengthen the perception that .NET has amongst the developers: both newcomers and experienced.

One way to give back to the community is to help any developer who wishes to adopt .NET as a development platform.  Also, collaborate with the other members of the Board of Directors to ensure our beloved technology keeps being polished and receives the love that it deserves.
