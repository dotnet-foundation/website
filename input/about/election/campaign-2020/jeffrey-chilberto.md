# .NET Foundation Campaign: Jeffrey Chilberto

## Why I'm Running

I want to contribute to the .Net Foundation in its support of the .Net community. As I have based a large portion of my career in .Net, I want to contribute back to the community by helping others to either start using .Net or to progress their projects. The .Net Foundation has an important role in supporting both user groups and individuals to build their skills as well as to feel they are part of something bigger. In other words, a community.

I believe that my varied background will bring several aspects to the .Net Foundation. Though not essential to being a member of the committee, I have a strong technical background in developing .Net solutions. I am involved with New Zealand based initiatives to get young people coding including [Kiwi Game Dev](https://kgd.nz) and [Code Club Aotearoa](codeclub.nz), as well not so young developers with the [New Zealand Game Developers Association](nzgda.com). This provides me with both an understanding of the professional business developer as well as the hobbyist or someone new to .Net.

Open source projects like the ones supported by the .Net Foundation are one of the great factors that make .Net the best platform for such a wide variety of scenarios. I would relish the opportunity to help shape the .Net Foundation and extend its support to the .Net community.

## My .NET Contributions

**Application Developer**
As an application developer, I have built web applications, middleware services, and games (Unity) in the US, UK, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. I have primarily worked in business software in the finance, telecommunication and education industries.

**Technical Author**
I have also co-authored several technical books for Packt, Apress and Wiley. Recently, I am a technical author for the [Azure Architecture Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/).

**Microsoft Partner**
I am a director of the [Spike Software Ltd](http://spikesoftware.co.nz/) providing bespoke software development for small to medium size businesses.

**Community**
I do not have a personal blog but instead contribute to the .Net community by writing articles on [TechNet Wiki](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/) and the [Microsoft Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/141713). I am a member of the local user groups including [Auckland Connected Systems User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Auckland-Connected-Systems-User-Group/) and [Auckland Azure User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Auckland-Azure-Usergroup/).
