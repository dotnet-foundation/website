# .NET Foundation Campaign: Jamie Howarth

## Why I'm Running
I'm Jamie Howarth, an independent ASP.NET consultant, ASPInsider, speaker, author and mentor.

During COVID-19 I've also been the de-facto CTO for [HelpYourHighStreet](https://helpyourhighstreet.org), and am currently the webmaster for the [Jo Cox Foundation's](https://jocoxfoundation.org) [Great Get Together](https://greatgettogether.org), both of which have given me experience in working in a transparent and accountable way with nonprofit organisations.

I've been contributing to various .NET projects for just over 10 years, and I'm running for election because I'd like to see .NET be taught more in K-12 education. There's thousands of resources for Python, Java, and various other languages out there, and I'd like to see .NET-based technologies, especially given .NET Core's appeal as a cross-platform runtime, be taught more in education and academia.

As a mentor for Code First: Girls in the UK, I'm currently writing a C# syllabus to be taught to young women aged 11-18 in the UK, and if elected, I'd like to help support similar initiatives around the globe through the Foundation. I've also been attending regular meetings of the outreach committee since April, including taking minutes at those meetings.

## My .NET Open Source Contributions
