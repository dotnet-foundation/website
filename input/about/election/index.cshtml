                <p>
                    Last year the .NET Foundation expanded the <a href="/about/board-of-directors">Board of Directors</a>
                    from three to seven members, with one single seat appointed by Microsoft and the remaining six elected by the community.
                    This structure has helped the .NET Foundation scale and better serve the .NET ecosystem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are preparing for our next set of Board elections and some changes are being made to the way we conduct these elections.
                    Namely, a Nominating Committee has been formed that will solicit and accept candidate applications and vet potential candidates that will then be voted on by members.
                    This committee was formed by the Board of Directors.
                    Additionally, we will begin term staggering of Board members to enhance the continuity of the organization. 
                    Please see the <a href="/about/election/policy">Election Policy</a> for more details.
