# What Excites Me About the Future of .NET Ecosystem
* I’m 110% into the Microsoft eco system. It’s easier to get different systems working together.
* I’ve worked with many teams at Microsoft to make our world better! My favorite part of being in the Microsoft MVP program. 
* Microsoft embraces other ecosystems! Very exciting to me.
# What Roll Can the .NET Foundation Can Play to Inspire Confidence in .NET?
* Reach out to developers to embrace and stay in the .NET Eco system.
* A non-Microsoft org can inspire developers and teams more in my mind. I listen my peers a lot more since they work in the real world every day, just like me.
* Work with speakers, OSS developers, provide videos and even internet shows and podcasts.
# How can the foundation Support OSS and Gain Credibility?
* I’ve always been weary of OSS since it’s not back by an organization. Create a way to ensure OSS projects on the foundation site adhere to a common set of standards to show confidence for teams to use OSS. With some type of award or recognition to ensure code bases do the following (minimum): Adheres to coding standards. Uses and passes code analytics. Very well documented. Benchmarked! How the OSS developers respond to issues.
# What Can the Foundation do Around Education and Adoption of .NET?
* Go into schools as low as middle school to inspire kids to get into software engineering.
* Community events and better organization of all .NET events.
* Education even teams at companies and focus on quality.
# What Would I Do Right Away if I Was on the Board?
* See how I can start or get involved in the board teaching topics to make OSS better quality and inspire confidence in it.
* See how I can start or get involved in the board teaching to kids in middle school and high school. Maybe even reach out to continuing education/ retraining groups. Get them excited in learning software engineering including making it a career.
