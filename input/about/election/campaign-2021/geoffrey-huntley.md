# .NET Foundation Campaign: Geoffrey Huntley

## Why I'm running

I think change is needed.

## Who am I?

You may know me as the guy who (literally and figuratively) put his Microsoft MVP award [in the shredder](https://www.crn.com.au/news/microsoft-pushes-mvps-influencers-to-spruik-azure-in-lead-up-to-aws-reinvent-563623). If you want someone who is biased towards open-source maintainers over the interest of Microsoft then I'm your guy.

I live, work and play outside of the .NET ecochamber and am known for always looking into other ecosystems for ideas to bring back home. 

There's unfinished business and I now have capacity ðŸ§¡

## Experience with the Foundation

If you know, you know. I was the core maintainer of one of the [earliest projects to join the .NET Foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org/blog/2017/08/08/welcome-reactiveui-to-the-net-foundation). 

## What are my goals for the .NET Foundation?

Focus the .NET Foundation on the [needs of open-source maintainers](https://medium.com/open-collective/funding-open-source-how-webpack-reached-400k-year-dfb6d8384e19). As a industry we haven't established the conditions where companies are readily able to mitigate risks related to software being produced by unpaid volunteers. The free software community has spent a lot of time and effort at discussing user freedoms however they have been almost silent on the unintended consequences.

The .NET ecosystem due to it's adoption by [billion dollar business](https://github.com/Fody/PropertyChanged/issues/270#issuecomment-320145654) faces unique challenges. Simon Cropp of Fody summarised it best with:

> How about this. point me to one significant contribution your billion dollar business has made to any open source project in the past month and i will go to the effort of supporting .NET 4.0
