# .NET Foundation Campaign: Virgile Bello

## Why I'm Running

I noticed a lack of candidatures representing the game development field and high-performance .NET.

I believe .NET is a perfect match not only for game development but also various related fields such as AI, language parsing, massively parallel programming (GPU and CPU) and such.

As a result, I would like the .NET Foundation to dedicate some resources to:
* Promote .NET in game development, AI, massively parallel programming and high-performance programming (i.e. be well represented at Game Developer Conferences and various other events)
People in those fields need to be aware .NET could be a valid alternative.
* Encourage the .NET ecosystem to take those use case into account (esp. for CoreCLR/CoreRT directions)
* Encourage support for more platforms (console, mobile, etc.)

## My .NET Contributions

* [Xenko](https://xenko.com): Lead developer of recently opensourced game engine [Xenko](https://xenko.com)
It features realistic rendering, VR, editor and [much more](https://xenko.com/features).

* [SharpLang](https://github.com/xen2/SharpLang): .NET to LLVM compiler and runtime prototype, no longer active since [CoreCLR](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr) came out)

* Various contributions to open source projects such as Mono, LLDB, etc.
