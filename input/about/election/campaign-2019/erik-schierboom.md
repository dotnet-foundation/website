## Why I'm Running
* **Passionate about .NET and open-source**  
I'm really passionate about .NET and open-source, and as such want to help make the .NET open-source ecosystem flourish.

* **Offer a different point of view**  
 I'm not the typical candidate, as I work for a relatively small company, don't live in the USA (I'm from Holland), and I'm not a "rockstar" developer by any means.  I also have experience in a lot other languages, such as F#, Kotlin, Scala, Ruby and Haskell. As such, I think I can really offer a different point of view.

* **Embrace F#**  
When talking about .NET, people usually assume you are doing C#. However, people often forget about F#, which is a brilliant language that runs on the .NET platform. Not only is F# a great language, it also has a vibrant community, with lots of great open-source projects like [FAKE](https://fake.build/), [Paket](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/), [Fable](https://fable.io/) and [Ionide](http://ionide.io/). I would like to help foster the embracing of F# and its community within the .NET foundation.

* **Support mentored learning**  
Learning a new language can be hard, but learning it while being mentored by an experienced developer can greatly help. This is why I love  the F# foundation's [mentorship program](https://fsharp.org/mentorship/index.html) and which is why I am a [mentor on Exercism](https://exercism.io/profiles/ErikSchierboom), in which I help people learn C# and F# through mentored learning.

* **Encouraging people to contribute**  
When my first open-source contribution was accepted, I felt great! I would like to support initiatives to help as many people as possible to get involved in open-source.

## My .NET Contributions

* **I've contributed to several .NET foundation projects**  
  As an example, I've contributed to [xUnit](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/commits?author=ErikSchierboom), [xUnit.analyzers](https://github.com/xunit/xunit.analyzers/commits?author=ErikSchierboom), [Humanizer](https://github.com/Humanizr/Humanizer/commits?author=ErikSchierboom) and [Cake](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/commits?author=ErikSchierboom).
  
* **I'm a core contributor to Exercism**    
  [Exercism](https://exercism.io) is an online platform designed to help you improve your coding skills through practice and mentorship. As a maintainer and mentor of the [C#](https://github.com/exercism/csharp/commits?author=ErikSchierboom) and [F#](https://github.com/exercism/fsharp/commits?author=ErikSchierboom) tracks, I'm responsible for creating the best learning platform for students wanting to learn C# or F# on Exercism.
