## Why I'm Running

I'm running because I would like to influence and inspire the direction of the foundation both in
general, but a few areas in particular:
* Increase communication between projects, combined there's a lot of know-how and experiences.
* Offer more services and guidance/recipes, to aid with maintaining projects.
* Increase .NET Foundation local presence, to raise awareness of the foundation and acknowledge local communities.
* Diversity, how can we grow and ensure a healthy .NET Community, mentorship, sponsorship, etc.
