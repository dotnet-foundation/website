## Who am I?

My name is Poornima Nayar. I have been a developer for the past 15 years. I am a 4-time Umbraco MVP and 2-time Microsoft MVP.
 
I am a freelance .NET Developer and I currently fulfil the role of CTO at WebmindSE in Sweden. I focus on technical architecture and strategy on projects, mentoring my team, and hands-on software development. 

I am a very active .NET and Umbraco Community member, speaking at various events internationally. I also blog occasionally and take part in podcasts.
 
As to the non-work side of me, I live in Berkshire, UK with my husband and 7-year-old daughter. My husband is a Server Engineer so you will find us talking tech a lot at home. I am also an aspiring singer; I restarted my training in Carnatic Music– a stream of Indian Classical Music – 5 years ago and I am now working towards a Diploma on the topic.

## Why I'm running

I started my career in India, where I was given enough training to get into the shoes of a Junior Developer. As much as I am grateful for those days, I still feel that there is an element missing and an unsureness when it comes to making technology and a career in software development a feasible and accessible option to a lot of people out there. 

"Isn't it challenging?", "How do you keep up with the updates in the tech world while mothering a child?", "I don't understand what you do!!" - these are some of the questions and conversations I deal with regularly in my life. For the past 3 years, throughout the lockdown, I have been working to address this balance through my talks and occasional blog posts. It is important that both technology and a career in technology sound feasible to anyone who is even remotely considering it. I try to address this too, by reassuring my audience that it is the attitude to learning and skilling up that matters. I have been a very vocal ambassador for learning and skilling up.

I believe that technology can be fun; you don't need to get alarmed by the fast-paced progress out there, you can choose a steady learning path for yourself, and pursue and maintain a successful career in development. This is something I strongly believe in and try to showcase to the world out there. If there is a time to pursue a career in tech, you won't get a better moment than now! This is something that I want to be more vocal about going ahead.

I am a very active community member for Umbraco, the .NET-based open-source CMS. People still have hesitation about open-source contributions. There is also the misconception that open-source contribution means a code contribution. My experience with Umbraco community has taught me that code contribution is only one of the ways of contributing – there are so many other ways to contribute. I would like to use my experience to get others started on a similar path and this is something I have been very vocal about whenever I have spoken about open source contributions.
 
If elected to the board of directors, I would also be representing women and mums in tech. I wish to be a role model, and inspire any girl or woman out there to not think twice before pursuing a career in tech.  

## My .NET Contributions

- I have been an Umbraco MVP for the past 4 years for my contributions to Umbraco, the .NET-based open-source CMS. I started my journey as a community member attending conferences and meet-ups. From there I gained confidence to make my first code contribution to Umbraco to the point I was the top contributor to the Umbraco CMS and Docs repositories during 2020-2021. I gained confidence from this journey to contribute to the .NET and a few other open-source repositories while continuing to contribute to Umbraco
- I have been a Microsoft MVP for the past 2 years
- I speak at a lot of conferences and meet-ups about .NET and Umbraco
- I have taken part in the *On .NET Live Show*, introducing Umbraco to the wider .NET community. I have always tried to bridge the gap between the Umbraco and .NET communities.
- I am an occasional blogger and my articles having a great readership! 
- I am a member of the #WomenOfDotNet initiative steering committee.
- I am an honorary member of the [Umbraco Core Collaborators Team](https://community.umbraco.com/community-teams/the-core-collaborators/). I was one of the first members of the team when it was formed and I was a team member from 2018 to 2020 when the team underwent a reshuffle.
- I have been selected as a member of the new [Headless Community Team](https://umbraco.com/blog/join-the-new-headless-community-team) at Umbraco that will act as an advisory team, or sounding board for Umbraco HQ’s product and Heartcore team. This is not public news yet!

## Experience with the Foundation

My experience and interaction with the Foundation has been minimal so far. I am keen to understand how I can be more involved and make tech more accessible and welcoming for everyone. In the past I have been in touch with the Foundation to become a member, be on the speakers' directory and also add some event information.
