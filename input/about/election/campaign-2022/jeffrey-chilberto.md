# .NET Foundation Campaign: Jeffrey Chilberto

## Why I'm running

As a large portion of my career has revolved around .NET applications and tools, I want to contribute back by helping others to either start using .NET, progress their understanding, or support those advocating for such a versatile and powerful language. Being a member of the .Net Foundation Board will be an excellent way for me to me to do this.

## Who am I?

My LinkedIn profile might show a bit of a mash up of developer, author, and speaker involved in several industries across several countries developing both business software and games. Though I value higher education having both a BSCS and MCSE, I also recognize formal education is not a replacement for real world experience and classroom learning is not for everyone. On reflection then, I would say the only constant since 2002 is .Net! 

## How am I involved with the community?

Mainly with New Zealand based initiatives to get young people coding including [Kiwi Game Dev](https://kgd.nz) and [Code Club Aotearoa](https://codeclub.nz/), as well as not so young developers with the [New Zealand Game Developers Association](https://nzgda.com/). I am a member of local user groups including [Auckland Connected Systems User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Auckland-Connected-Systems-User-Group/) and [Auckland Azure User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Auckland-Azure-Usergroup/). 
I have co-authored several technical books for Packt and Apress and have been a technical author for some articles of the [Azure Architecture Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/). I do not have a personal blog but instead contribute to the .NET community by writing articles on [TechNet Wiki](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/) and the [Microsoft Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/141713).
