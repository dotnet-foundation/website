# Orchard Core

[Orchard Core](https://www.orchardcore.net/) Orchard Core is an 
open-source modular and multi-tenant application framework built 
with ASP.NET Core, and a content management system (CMS) built 
on top of that application framework. All components in Orchard 
Core can be replaced or extended. Content is built from easily
composable building blocks. Modules extend the system in a very
decoupled fashion, where a commenting module for example can as easily
apply to pages, blog posts, photos or products. A rich UI composition
system completes the picture and ensures that you can get the exact
presentation that you need for your content.
