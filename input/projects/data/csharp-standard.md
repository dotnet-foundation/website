# C# language standard

[TC49-TG2](https://www.ecma-international.org/task-groups/tc49-tg2/) writes the official C# standard. The scope is to standardize the syntax and semantics of a modern, component-based, general purpose, object oriented, and type-safe programming language called C# (pronounced C sharp).

The committee programme of work:

1. Develop C# language standards.
1. Upon completion of item 1, to investigate the future direction of C# standards, and to evaluate and consider proposals for complementary or additional technology.
1. To establish and maintain liaison with other Ecma TCs and with other Standards Development Organisations (SDOs) as appropriate to facilitate and promulgate the work of the TG.

**Important**: This committee does not propose enhancements to the language. Its purpose is to produce the standard based on the reference implementation from the [Roslyn project](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn).
