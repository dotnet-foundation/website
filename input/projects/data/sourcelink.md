# SourceLink

Source Link is a language- and source-control agnostic system for providing first-class source debugging experiences for binaries. The goal of the project is to enable anyone building [NuGet libraries to provide source debugging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/library-guidance/sourcelink) for their users with almost no effort. Microsoft libraries, such as .NET Core and Roslyn have enabled Source Link. Source Link is supported by Microsoft.
