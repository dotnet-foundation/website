# Welcome 
The Outreach Committee is here to welcome developers of all backgrounds, education, and technology ecosystems into the .NET ecosystem. We are here to help you organize and evangelize. 

## Working Group
If you'd like to see what we're working on, please visit us at our GitHub Working Group:

> https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-outreach

## High-Level Goals of the .NET Foundation Outreach Committee
- Encourage new developers to build with .NET
- Empower underrepresented segments of the coder community to become leaders and contributors
- Assist event organizers with evangelism and growth

## The Committee Polled the .NET Community and Identified 2020-21 Priorities
- Educating and assisting .NET developers in contributing to Open Source Software
- Conference sponsorships (_e.g._, travel, lodging, tickets) _(post-COVID)_
- Affinity group outreach and sponsorship

## Joining the Committee & Meetings
The Outreach Committee currently meets for one hour on the **2nd Tuesday of every month at 3:00 pm ET**. Meetings are held on Microsoft Teams. If you are passionate about Community Outreach and .NET Advocacy, we would love to hear from you! To join the the committee and the meetings, _please request to [join the outreach team](https://github.com/orgs/dotnet-foundation/teams/outreach)_ and then post a message there with your desire to be added to the meeting invite.

We have several ongoing Outreach initiatives that will benefit from motivated Foundation members who can commit some of their volunteer time toward making the .NET ecosystem more welcoming and robust for communities around the world.

## Current Initiatives

### Virtual Meetups
To participate in the [.NET Virtual Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/dotnet-virtual-user-group/) or to have your local community's meeetup streamed on the [.NET Foundation YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiaZbznpWV1o-KLxj8zqR6A) account, please submit your meetup information via [this form](https://bit.ly/2OohRR2). You can read more about the Virtual Meetups at [.NET Foundation Virtual Meetups](/community/virtual-user-group).

### Underrepresented Communities
Recently, the Outreach Committee has taken the first steps toward its goal of empowering leaders and contributors in growing .NET communities in underrepresented areas around the world. We already know that amazing developers and community organizers can be found everywhere. Our goal—working with leaders in Africa, South Asia, and South and Central America—is to promote the work of these communities and to foster improved cross-collaboration and learning among such geographically widespread and diverse developers.

### Speaker Directory
The Outreach Committee is actively shepherding an effort to create a global .NET speaker directory. If you are a speaker from anywhere around the world and you want to help user groups and conferences find you for .NET topics, the speaker directory can help!  Please watch this space for more news on the launch of the Speaker Directory!

## Proposals
We are about empowering you and your organizations. If you have an idea of how we can help, please post an Issue in the GitHub repository for the working group. You can see more about the proposal process (still a work-in-progress) in our [guide to proposals](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-outreach/blob/master/proposals.md).
