# Welcome 
The Outreach Committee is here to welcome developers of all backgrounds, education, and technology ecosystems into the .NET ecosystem. We are here to help you organize and evangelize. 

## Working Group
If you'd like to see what we're working on, please visit us at our GitHub Working Group:

## The  high-level goals of the .NET Foundation Outreach Committee are:
- Encourage new developers to build with .NET
- Empower underrepresented segments of the coder community to become leaders and contributors
- Assist event organizers with evangelism and growth

## The committee has polled the .NET community and identified the following as 2020 priorities:
- Educating and assisting .NET developers in contributing to Open Source
- Conference sponsorships (travel, lodging, tickets)
- Affinity group outreach and sponsorship
