## Bio
Before joining Microsoft, I was working at Intel Corporation as a Machine Learning/Deep Learning/AI and Modern Code (aka Parallel programming and Optimization) Technical Evangelist; and as Principal HPC Research and Consulting Engineer at Colfax International involved in training and consultancy projects on data mining, software development and statistical analysis of complex systems. My research interests are in the areas of physical modeling with HPC clusters, highly parallel architectures, code optimization; machine learning and AI. 

I hold a PhD in computational biophysics from North Carolina State University for my research on the free energy and stability of helical secondary structures of proteins. I am a co-author of the book, "Parallel Programming and Optimization with Intel® Xeon Phi™ Coprocessors", and was a lead instructor of a developer training course of the same name. 6 hours of this video material is available on Intel website, and soon on Coursera. 

After work I'm a CrossFit enthusiast, newbie VR gamer, and a mentor for "Codding Interview" meetup. I live in downtown of Seattle and still actively exploring Puget Sound area. I moved here from California (where I lived for 5 years) less than 2 months ago. If you want to join me on a hike – let me know!
