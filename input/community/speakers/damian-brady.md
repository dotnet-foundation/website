## Bio
Damian is a Cloud Advocate specializing in DevOps and MLOps. After spending a year in Toronto, Canada, he returned to Australia - the land of the dangerous creatures and beautiful beaches - in 2018.

Formerly a dev at [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com) and a Microsoft MVP, he has a background in software development and consulting in a broad range of industries. In Australia, he co-organised the Brisbane .Net User Group, and launched the now annual [DDD Brisbane](http://dddbrisbane.com) conference. He regularly speaks at conferences, User Groups, and other events around the world.

Most of the time you'll find him talking to software engineers, IT pros and managers to help them get the most out of their DevOps strategies.

Damian has his own [Channel 9](https://channel9.microsoft.com) show - [The DevOps Lab](https://aka.ms/devopslab). Check it out for real-world guidance on implementing DevOps in your organisation!
