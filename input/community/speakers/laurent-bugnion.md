## Bio
I come to Microsoft after a long career in the industry as a software developer. Initially an electrical engineer, I started coding professionally for Siemens in the 90s (in C!) and did a postgrade education in software engineering. Back then all the cool kids did Java and so I did too. Those were fun days but then I discovered .NET in 2001 and never looked back. I did it all, from WinForms to WebForms to ASP.NET. But I was always interested in design and so when Siemens sent me to Vegas at the first MIX conference and I discovered XAML and Blend, I was sold. The next years were spent doing a lot of WPF, Silverlight (Loved it!) and all subsequent XAML-based technologies.

I wrote Silverlight 2 Unleashed for Sams in 2008 and later Silverlight 4 Unleashed. In 2009 I also published an Model-View-Viewmodel framework called MVVM Light Toolkit which has become surprisingly popular, and led me to speak about this architecture pattern and the XAML (and later Xamarin) technologies all around the world. I spoke at MIX three times (2009, 2010, 2011) which is one of the most amazing experiences of my professional life. Even though I was more of a client guy, I am really excited about Azure. Next to being a Windows Dev MVP from 2007 to 2017, I was also a Microsoft Regional Director since 2013 ( [http://rd.microsoft.com](http://rd.microsoft.com)) and I saw how excited this amazing group of people is about Azure. It is clear for me that this is the place to be. That's why I got really excited when I received the offer to join this team and work with a lot of friends and colleagues on promoting and teaching it.

On the private side, I love to garden (I have a fish pond with water lilies, toads, newts, and many fishes of many kinds), go hiking in the Swiss mountains that I call home, travel all around the world and explore. I recently acquired a DJI Mavic Pro quadcopter which led me to [start making videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb_gm1NXTZXyvqgXAh_H32A/videos) as well [as pictures](https://www.instagram.com/lbugnion/) of the amazing places I am lucky to visit. I love to spend time with my family (I have two teenage daughters, who can be both adorable and exhausting) and friends. A big part of my professional activity is speaking at conferences worldwide, and I love to travel and meet, train, teach people everywhere I can.
