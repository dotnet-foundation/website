My name is Jeff Alstadt and I have been developing .NET for over 14 years. I currently work as a Principal at West Monroe.

I am passionate about .NET, helping clients build solid scalable digital products, building strong product development teams, and giving back to the community.
I have talked a lot about various technologies and how they can integrate with the .NET platform. 

My professional interests lie in the space of microservices and enterprise backend architecture design, Azure functions, Kubernetes, Terraform, SQL Server, Apache Cassandra, Apache Pulsar, Redis, ElasticSearch and MongoDB. I have built enterprise services in Docker and Azure cloud that have powered logistics, education, healthcare and ecommerce sites.
I am passionate about the C# language, but I have as well built enterprise services in Java/Spring Boot.

In giving back to the community, I helped to co-found the Software Development Community on Meetup, avid speaker at Chicago Code Camp and have given talks on .NET and Redis at RedisConf. 

Personally, I have a family, live in Chicago, married to my loving husband, Jose, and happy dog dad of two loving min-pins, Bella and Edward. I also speak German fluently. When not coding, I am active in fitness with most recently running the Chase 5K. I also volunteer with Code Platoon, an organization that helps veterans become software developers, and Dank Haus German American Cultural Center.
