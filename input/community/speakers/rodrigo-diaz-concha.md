I'm a solutions architect with 20+ years of experience and a member of the Microsoft Regional Director program. I've been awarded as Microsoft MVP for over a decade, currently in the Microsoft Azure category.

I'm a certified Carnegie Mellon SEI Software Architecture Professional, Scrum Alliance Certified ScrumMaster, MCSD, MCTS, MCPD, and MCP.

As the chief software architect at Lumedhealth, I build digital health and telemedicine solutions focused on transforming people's lives. I also have the distinction of writing the first books about Microsoft Silverlight 5 and Xamarin.Forms in the Spanish language. I'm a frequent speaker at Microsoft and non-Microsoft events all over Latin America, the US, and Europe.

## My .NET Contributions
