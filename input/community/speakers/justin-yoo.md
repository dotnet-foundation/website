## Bio
I started my career as an HR consultant at Samsung for a few years. It was specialising in internal career development for engineers. Funnily enough, their successful career development influenced mine, and I changed my job to become a developer!

During my software development career, I worked for many different companies as a developer or consultant in a wide range of industries. Throughout my career, learning something and sharing it with others is always my passion. It led me to become a double-awarded Microsoft MVP, and now I become a Cloud Advocate at Microsoft.

I am interested in how organisations successfully migrate their on-prem information systems to the cloud by adopting PaaS like serverless and messaging. Most of the time, I am looking for real-world stories to help organisations introduce cloud products and services via my blog posts and conference talks.

I run two blogs &ndash; [aliencube](https://blog.aliencube.org) in Korean and [devkimchi](https://devkimchi.com) in English. I also maintain a handful of [open-source projects](https://github.com/aliencube) and [sample codes](https://github.com/devkimchi) for DevOps, serverless, integration and messaging.
