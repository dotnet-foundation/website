Kia ora, I’m an experienced .NET/Unity/Azure Developer @Company-X and I’m a Microsoft MVP since October 2015. Before joining Company-X, I worked for Company-U (Unity), the creator of the world’s most widely-used real-time 3D development platform, as a Field Engineer. As a Field Engineer at Unity, I provided in-depth consultation and support to developers who use Unity for their games and simulations(AR/VR/XR) dev. My clients include Tencent, Netease, Perfect World, Seasun, etc.

I have participated in the Unite Conf(Beijing & Shanghai) twice as a speaker. And I attended the Microsoft Ignite the Tour Beijing conf as a speaker, too.

Before joining Unity, I was a game programmer and the organizer of the Beijing Unity User Group(UUG). I like to write technical blogs (of course mostly in Chinese), and my first book about Unity&C# was published in 2016.
