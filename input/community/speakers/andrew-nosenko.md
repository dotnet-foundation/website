I'm a problem solver at heart with special interest in asynchrony, concurrency and multithreading with .NET and C#.
Although I don't have a lot of public speaking experience, I gave a few talks at [Sydney ALT.NET Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Sydney-Alt-Net) and one of them, ["Asynchronous coroutines with C#"](https://youtu.be/pE6b2Bs3U9Q), was accepted for .NET Conf.
I'm also active on StackOverflow, where I believe I've contributed [some interesting questions and answers](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1768303/noseratio?tab=profile).
