## Bio 
Brian Ketelsen is probably most widely known for his role in the Go community: co-organizing Gophercon, co-hosting the GoTime.FM podcast, and co-authoring Go in Action for Manning Press. He's been programming since he was 10, starting on a TI-99 4A. His broad background includes roles as a DBA, Developer, CIO, and nearly everything in-between. Brian built his first custom Linux distribution in 2007, which was used by colleges and companies like IBM to make developing with Ruby on Rails easier. Biggest contribution to Open Source: SkyDNS, which powers service discovery in Kubernetes.
