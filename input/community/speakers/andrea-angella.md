I am a Microsoft MVP, Senior .NET Engineer at Redgate Software, and .NET Community Leader. I am the founder and speaker at the Cambridge .NET User Group, the official community on .NET in Cambridge (UK), consisting of 1000+ passionate .NET developers. I am the Productive C# membership founder, where I help developers master the C# programming language and related .NET technologies. My peers describe me as really enthusiastic, motivated, with an infinite passion for software development, and a relentless desire to keep learning as well as a fantastic ability to involve others in my pursuit of excellence.
