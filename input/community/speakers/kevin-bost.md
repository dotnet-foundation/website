Hi, I'm Kevin Bost, and I'm a Microsoft MVP with a passion for open-source software.  During the day, I work as a senior software architect with [IntelliTect](https://intellitect.com). I have also contributed to [Essential C# 8]( https://intellitect.com/EssentialCSharp/), the seventh book in the Essential C# series. I enjoy teaching and training and often stream developer-related content on [Twitch](https://twitch.keboo.dev) and [YouTube](https://youtube.keboo.dev).
 
In my spare time, I enjoy working on open-source projects. I'm the maintainer of several open-source projects, including [MaterialDesignInXAML]( https://github.com/MaterialDesignInXAML/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit), [Moq.AutoMocker](https://github.com/moq/Moq.AutoMocker), [ShowMeTheXAML]( https://github.com/Keboo/ShowMeTheXAML), and [AutoDI](https://github.com/Keboo/AutoDI). I also contribute 
To [System.CommandLine](https://github.com/dotnet/command-line-api), a Microsoft library that significantly improves building command-line applications.
