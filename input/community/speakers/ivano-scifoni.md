Since I was a child I have been fascinated by computer science where I have the first approaches with the Commodore 64.

In 98 I started to enter the world of work and I developed client / server applications in VB for a small company in Rome.

Fascinated by the internet I moved on to web programming, which I still follow today, passing through various technologies java, php, ASP, ASP.NET.

Looking for new experiences, I am also a contributor for the ASP.NET MVC Core project.

Today I am a community leader and speaker at SharpCoding.
