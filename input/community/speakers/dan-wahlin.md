## Bio
Dan is a web developer, architect, and Principal Cloud Developer Advocate living in Chandler, AZ. He works with JavaScript/TypeScript, C#, ASP.NET Core, Node.js, Azure, Microsoft 365, and Docker/Kubernetes. Prior to joining Microsoft Dan ran a consulting, training, and architecture company for 20 years called Wahlin Consulting and provided technology services to developers and corporations around the world.

Dan is focused on helping developers integrate real-time collabration solutions into their apps using the Fluid Framework and helping to bridge Microsoft 365 and Azure services. 

When he's not staring at a computer screen Dan enjoys hanging out with his family, getting outdoors, playing golf or basketball, and jetskiing at the one of the many lakes in Arizona (especially during the summer).
