## Bio
Hi, I'm CDA Aaron Powell, you might remember me from such roles as a [Readify](https://readify.net) consultant, organiser of [DDD Sydney](https://www.dddsydney.com.au) or presenting at events.

My background is web development, in the 15 years I've been in the industry I've done server side and client side development, which I guess makes me a full-stack developer these days. But my passion is front end, whether it's vanilla JavaScript, React or that new framework released in the last 5 minutes.

Mostly I like to have fun with techonolgy, whether it's using [Docker in ways you probably shouldn't](https://www.aaron-powell.com/posts/2017-11-13-debugging-powershell-from-vscode-on-linux/), [writing your own number type in C#](https://github.com/aaronpowell/Surrealism) or generally embracing [stupid ideas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ty08C_yYyk).

My goal is to make sure people have fun, grown in what they do and are all round better developers.
