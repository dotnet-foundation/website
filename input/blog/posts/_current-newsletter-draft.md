#### NUnit: Commemorating Charlie Poole's Contributions to the NUnit Project

After **over 20 years** of stewarding the NUnit Project, Charlie Poole is stepping back. From [our announcement](https://nunit.org/news/update/nunit/2023/01/29/celebrating-charlie-poole.html): 

> This month, Charlie Poole completed his transition in stepping back from the Core team of the NUnit project. We’d be remiss if we didn’t take a moment to recognize and thank Charlie, who we consider to be part of the founding generation of .NET OSS, and to whom we owe a debt of gratitude.
> 
> To attempt to quantify Charlie’s contributions to NUnit is a daunting task. He was the lead of NUnit across at least 207 releases in 37 different repositories, authoring 4,898 commits across them. He participated in 2,990 issues, 1,305 PRs, and impacted 6,992,983 lines of code. And those are only the ones we can easily find; our numbers are sourced from after NUnit moved the project to GitHub in 2011, which means there are at least 9 additional years of work not quantified above.

* Send some love Charlie's way and thank him for his incredible run in this project.
