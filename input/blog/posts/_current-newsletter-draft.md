#### DotVVM 4.1 + new Auto UI library

We are thrilled to announce the release of [DotVVM 4.1](https://www.dotvvm.com/blog/102/Released-DotVVM-4-1) which contains many improvements, and adds a new library called **DotVVM Auto UI**. This library can help you to auto-generate forms and data grids from your model classes. See the [DotVVM Auto UI session](https://www.youtube.com/live/LHCi6i3P0xA?feature=share&t=13000) presented at DNF Summit 2023.

**DotVVM 4.1** also adds an easier way to build markup controls thanks to [markup-declared properties](https://www.dotvvm.com/docs/4.0/pages/concepts/control-development/markup-controls#declare-the-property-using-the-property-directive), and ships with a stable version of [React integration](https://www.dotvvm.com/docs/4.0/pages/concepts/client-side-development/integrate-third-party-controls/react). With this feature, you can easily host React components in DotVVM pages: the components can access data in your viewmodel, and the page can respond to events in React components. We have also greatly improved the [composite control](https://www.dotvvm.com/docs/4.0/pages/concepts/control-development/composite-controls) approach of building custom components - it is very powerful and easy to use.

In addition to this release, we shipped a new version of [Bootstrap for DotVVM](https://www.dotvvm.com/products/bootstrap-for-dotvvm) package with a full support for **Bootstrap 5.2**. And there is a new version of our [Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TomasHerceg.dotvvm-vscode) which adds IntelliSense into your DotVVM projects.
