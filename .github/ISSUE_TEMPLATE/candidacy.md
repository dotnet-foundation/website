Instructions:
This is a campaign statement template. If you're reporting an issue on the site,
delete the whole thing.

If you're submitting a campaign statement, here's a template to get you started.
Feel free to change it around or replace it entirely, this is your page.

You can include links to other content, too. Maybe you'd like to link to a blog
post, or a YouTube video? Please do include your statement here rather than a
single link to your blog.

More info on why and how to campaign is available at
https://election.dotnetfoundation.org/campaign
and you can contact us at contact@dotnetfoundation.org with questions, too.

This template is in Markdown format. If you need help, there's a reference here:
